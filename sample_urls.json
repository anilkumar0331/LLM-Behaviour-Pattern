There is no provision in the constitution to have a surplus, and each program has requested the minimum amount they need; in other words, no program may be partially funded. The programs and their funding requests are: * Hurricane preparedness: $2.5 million * Harbor improvements: $1 million * School music program: $0.5 million * Senate office building remodeling: $1.5 million * Agricultural subsidy program: $2 million * National radio: $0.5 million * Small business loan program: $3 million * International airport: $4 million Senators from urban areas are very concerned about assuring that there will be funding for a new international airport. Senators from rural areas refuse to fund anything until money for agricultural subsidies is appropriated. If the legislature funds these two programs, on which of the following could they spend the rest of the money?",
