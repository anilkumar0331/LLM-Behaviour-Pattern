                "context": "Oh, you thought buried treasure was nothing more than a fairytale plot line? Quite the contrary. From gold to gemstones to copper to possibly even a queen's jewels, there are throngs of extremely valuable items hidden away in the mountains, coves, and oceans of the YOU.S. Some are easier to find than others. You might, for example, find treasure after just one afternoon immersed in Arkansas' Crater of Diamonds. On the other hand, you could spend a lifetime trying to decode the ciphers that apparently lead to a Virginia trove and still come away empty-handed. Choose your challenge with these eight destinations for modern-day treasure hunters. Doug Wertman / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY 2.0 Diamonds were first discovered on the site that is now known as Crater of Diamonds State Park in the early 1900s. After failed attempts at commercial mining, the rural southwestern Arkansas treasure trove became a 900-acre tourist attraction. Public interest was piqued in the 1950s, when a 15-carat stonelater named the Star of Arkansaswas discovered. Today, a 37-acre plowed field in the middle of the park acts as the diamond-hunting hub. More than 29,000 diamonds have been found since the Crater of Diamonds became a state park. That is about 600 per year, according to the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism, and the policy is \"finders, keepers.\" Virginia State Parks / Flickr / CC BY 2.0 One of Americas strangest treasure stories involves a series of ciphers that supposedly tell the whereabouts of a treasure buried in Bedford, Virginia. In 1819, Thomas Beale and a group of men reportedly brought a large treasure they found in the American West to their home state of Virginia, where they buried it. Beale subsequently wrote three ciphers that would reveal the location and contents of the treasure in case something would happen to the men when they returned to the West for more treasure. None of them ever returned, and no one was able to decipher Beale's codes. After the story was made public in the 1880s, people were able to decode one of the ciphers, but it spoke only of the contents of the treasure, not its location. Many claim the whole story is a hoax, but cryptographers continue to try to crack the codes today. Bryan Hughes / Flickr / CC BY-SA 2.0 Jade is a semiprecious gemstone, often green in color, that can be found on the shore and in the waters of Jade Cove, a scenic seaside area in Big Sur on Californias Central Coast. Scuba divers tend to find the largest stones offshore, but casual treasure seekers sometimes find sizable pebbles on the beach during low tide or after a storm. Jade Cove is an idyllic place to hunt for treasurethe stunning coastal scenery can be as rewarding as finding a gemstone. The cove is quite difficult to access, which helps keep the number of jade-seekers down. Also, regulations stipulate that only hand tools are allowed to help extract the jade and that collectors may only take what they can carry themselves. Thenakedchef / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 3.0 Auburn was a major destination for Gold Rush-era prospectors. After gold was discovered there in 1848, thousands of miners came to the area. Auburns restored Old Town hearkens back to this 19th-century heyday. More than a century later, gold seekers have now returned to Auburn, inspired by rising gold prices and TV shows that follow the exploits of modern-day gold miners. Many of Auburns new prospectors pan for gold along the American River in the Auburn State Recreation Area. Some boost their chances by using metal detectors. The Recreation Area office has published a list of rules for prospectors: Pans are the only \"tools\" allowed, findings must not be sold for profit, and no one may gather more than 15 pounds of mineral material per day, etc. In the past, people have actually been arrested for trespassing and taking gold from property owned by private mining companies. A lucrative copper mine was once operating near the Current River in Missouris Ozark Hills. In the mid-18th century, the mines owner, Joseph Slater, would allegedly float large amounts of high-grade copper down to New Orleans. In an effort to keep the location of his mine secret, he filed a claim for the mine several miles from where it actually was. This means that the location of one of the countrys most profitable copper mines was never known to anyone but Slater and his daughter. Slater moved away with intentions of returning to the mine one day, but he died before he could do so. It is said that he and his daughter carefully covered its entrance so that no one would be able to find it before they returned, but treasure hunters and curiosity seekers have been scouring the area for almost a century to no avail. Thus, it is been dubbed the Lost Copper Mine. One of the largest remaining unfound treasures in the YOU.S. is thought to be sitting somewhere along the Atlantic coast of Florida. Small finds like hundreds of gold coins have created a sort of trail of breadcrumbs, suggesting that the San Miguel, a Spanish treasure ship lost in 1715, went down near Amelia Island. The vessel was carrying gold and other valuable itemspotentially the Queen's jewelsthat Amelia Research & Recovery says could be worth as much as $2 billion today. Despite finding fragments of other ships that were part of the Spanish cargo fleet alongside the San Miguel, no one has found the suspected billion-dollar haul yet. One salvage company, Queens Jewels, now owns rights to the 1715 fleet shipwreck site, and up to two dozen subcontractors sign up to search the site alongside it every summer.

Binion died in 1998, allegedly at the hands of his girlfriend and her lover, who were potentially motivated by a highly valuable silver collection. After his death, Nye County police discovered a 12-foot-deep vault containing six tons of silver bullion, cash, and thousands of rare coins on one of Binion's properties in Pahrump. While much of the discovered silver went to Binion's daughter, much more of itmillions of dollars' worthis thought to remain buried on the property. In 2019, one of Binion's former ranch hands was arrested for attempting to dig it up. Daniel Case / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 3.0 Dutch Schultz (real name Arthur Flegenheimer) was a well-known crime boss in New York City during the '20s. He made a fortune with bootlegged liquor, illegal lotteries, and other criminal activities. When he was being prosecuted for tax evasion, Schultz allegedly stashed some of his fortune in a secret location in the Catskill Mountains. The treasure was said to include cash in the form of $1,000 bills, diamonds, and gold coins. Schultz was acquitted of tax evasion, but prosecutors started pursuing other charges, so he was not able to retrieve his hidden loot. He managed to avoid jail but was eventually gunned down on orders from rival crime bosses. Some say Schultz mumbled incoherently about the treasure as he bled out after being shot. Others tell of maps that the city-dwelling mob men were unable to decipher. Many think the treasure is buried near the hamlet of Phoenicia, New York."

                "context": "This Minecraft tutorial explains how to find Buried Treasure with screenshots and step-by-step instructions. Starting in the Aquatic Update, there are shipwrecks, Buried Treasure Maps and Buried Treasure. Let us explore how to find Buried Treasure in Minecraft. First, you need to find a shipwreck in Minecraft. A shipwreck looks like the ruins of a sunken ship and is found in Ocean, River and Beach biomes. Shipwrecks usually spawn underwater, however in rare cases, you may find a shipwreck on land in a Beach biome. This is what a shipwreck looks like: Each shipwreck can have up to 3 chests, depending on the size of the shipwreck - Map Chest, Treasure Chest and Supply Chest. To find the Buried Treasure, you will need to look for the Map Chest in the shipwreck. Open the Map Chest and move the Buried Treasure Map to your inventory. Next, use the Buried Treasure Map to find the location of the Buried Treasure. The white dot shows your location and it also indicates the direction that you are facing. The red X shows the location of the Buried Treasure. Move towards the Buried Treasure. As you move closer, the map detail will fill in. Once the white dot is at the same position as the red X, you are above the Buried Treasure. Start digging until you find a chest. This could take a while depending on your luck. Dig until you find a chest that looks like this: Now open the chest and move the Buried Treasure to your inventory. Congratulations, you just learned how to find Buried Treasure in Minecraft.

                "context": "There is no surprise that Minecraft is often called an exploration game. Everyone spawns in a unique world and makes their way through the best and worst of the game. Some find amazing loots while others drop into the dangerous dripstone caves. However, one thing that takes both exploration and looting to the next level is the buried treasure. That is, as long as you know how to find a buried treasure in Minecraft. Similar to pirating in the open sea with a boat, Minecraft offers a treasure map, sunken ships, and rare loot in this side quest. In fact, buried treasures are the only source of finding the heart of the sea, used to gain superpower-like abilities. Additionally, unlike most other stuff, the treasure functions similarly in both Minecraft Java and Bedrock editions. But first, you need to learn how to make a boat in Minecraft before jumping into this side quest. With that said, from a shipwreck to the treasure itself, we will cover the whole process of how to find buried treasure in Minecraft. Find Buried Treasure in Minecraft (2022) Before we loot the treasure, we have to find the map that leads to it. And even before that, we need to focus on getting to a Shipwreck. Do not be overwhelmed, though, as we will go over each step in detail. Due to uniqueness in Minecraft worlds, some steps might take longer than usual. But you will still know everything about searching for and using buried treasure maps in Minecraft. Table of Contents What is a Buried Treasure?Where to Look for a Buried Treasure Map?Find a ShipwreckFind a Map ChestUnderstand The Map To Find Buried Treasure in MinecraftHow To Use Buried Treasure MapDig and Loot the Buried Treasure Chest What is a Buried Treasure? Buried treasure is a loot chest in Minecraft with many rare items. From food items to tools and minerals, it has several things that can help you survive in the game. If you are planning to create a Conduit in Minecraft, you will need this chest. It is the only source of the Heart of the sea. Creating a conduit with it will give you Minecraft beacon-like powers but focus on underwater mobs. Where to Look for a Buried Treasure Map? A buried treasure is usually found on the ocean floor or buried under the beach. But, you will need a buried treasure map to locate it. You can only find the map at two rare locations. The first one is the underwater ruin, which has less than 50% chance of having the map. The second location is the shipwrecks, which, at times, contain a map chest. If there is a map chest, there will be surely a buried treasure map in it. For our tutorial, due to the higher spawn rate of map chests, we will focus on the shipwrecks instead of the underwater ruins. Find a Shipwreck As you can tell from the name, shipwrecks are damaged ship-like structures that spawn in the overworld. Unlike villages, shipwrecks are rarely generated structures. You can find them under the ocean, floating on the ocean surface, and sitting on the beaches. So, you will have to visit all oceanic Minecraft biomes until you find a shipwreck. Looking underwater is the safest bet as that is where you will most commonly find it. If the shipwreck is underwater, it will look something like the screenshot below. Underwater Shipwreck without (L) and with (R) Night Vision Yeah, some ocean biomes in Minecraft can limit your visibility, so using the Potion of Night Vision is a great workaround for finding these underwater structures. As a structure, the shipwreck is entirely made out of wood. Much like a real ship, it can have decks, masts, cabins, and even trap doors in it. But most of the time, you will not find a complete ship as a shipwreck. Most of them are missing either their front, rear, or other random parts. As mentioned earlier, finding a shipwreck in any condition is a good deal in itself. But then, you also need to hope that it has a buried treasure map onboard. Find a Map Chest In a Minecraft world, a shipwreck can have three chests at most. But only one of them will be a map chest. The map chests are located in the lower section of the shipwrecks. That means you will have to break some parts of the shipwreck before reaching the chest. If you do not find a map chest in your shipwreck, you can still go home with amazing loot from a supply or treasure chest. There is no set way to identify a map chest without opening it, but it is usually in the following situation for most shipwrecks: Top View of a Map Chest in a Shipwreck Once you find a map chest, you should look for a Buried Treasure Map in it. Every map chest in every edition of the game has it. Other than that, you can commonly find paper, feathers, and books in it. On rare occasions, you will also find a clock, compass, or a regular map in the chests. You can place the buried treasure map in your inventory and exit the shipwreck to start the search. Understand The Map To Find Buried Treasure in Minecraft Once you have the buried treasure map, make sure to place it in your active inventory  the bottom-most line in your inventory. This way, it will be visible throughout the game and accessible with ease. Then, scroll to it till your player has equipped it. You can then look at it. If you have used maps in-game before, it will look somewhat similar to this. In terms of directions, the top of the map is North and the bottom is South. Meanwhile, the left side is West and the right side is East. A white circular mark will indicate your current position on the map. And finally, the red cross or the X on the map is where the treasure is buried. To make it work, you first need to understand the directions and your position in the Minecraft world. How To Use Buried Treasure Map 1. Check the area where you are on your map, and you will understand your geographical position. As you can see, my current location on the following map is South-West. That is opposite to the X mark. So, I need to move North-East to get to the mark. 2. Next, we need to check which direction our player is facing. On the Minecraft Java Edition, you can quickly press the F3 key to open up the information panel. On the left side, you will see the direction your player is facing. If you are playing the Bedrock edition, you will have to manually try moving into random directions or use the sunrise/ sunset to determine the correct movement. Even in Minecraft, the sun rises from the East and sets in the West. 3. Next, once you know the direction you are facing in your Minecraft world, you need to move towards the ideal direction. In my case, the buried treasure is present in the North-East direction. So, I will move North first and East next once I am close to the mark. If you move in the correct direction, your map should look like the screenshot below after traveling some distance. Also, if you are close enough, you will start seeing the world forming onto the map. 4. Next, after you finish traveling in one direction and coming parallel to the X, it is time to move towards it. Now, you need to move in the next direction, which is ideally towards the X. In my case, it is the East direction. If your player indicator has been close to the edge until now, you will start seeing it move towards the main part of the map. Keep moving until you are right on top of the X from every direction. The X should completely cover your player Indicator. Dig and Loot the Buried Treasure Chest Now, if you are lucky, you will find the buried treasure right below the X mark on the map. But most players have to dig the whole area around the X to find the buried treasure in Minecraft. It is mostly buried in beaches, but sometimes you might also find it under the ocean floor. Usually, it is covered by either sand or gravel blocks. It can also have stone on top of it in case of spawning into an underwater hill. On opening the chest, you will see a ton of loot. The heart of the sea is always in a buried treasure. But you can also find a lot of other items, including armors and cooked salmon to iron ingots and emeralds. You can find a complete list of possible loot items for both game editions on Minecraft Wiki. Find and Use Buried Treasure Map in Minecraft With the ability to find a Buried Treasure in Minecraft, you can take your ocean quests on a completely different level. And what better way to start one than one of our best Minecraft island seeds. These seeds spawn you on a survival island, offering you the perfect opportunity to look for buried treasures and go on sea adventures. Though, if you are running the latest Minecraft 1.18 update, digging down into some of the beautiful lush caves might be a fresher alternative. Well, at least until the Warden comes in the Minecraft 1.19 mob update to make cave exploration riskier. Coming back to the treasure, the hardest part of the process will be finding a Shipwreck with a map chest. Some players even use particular Minecraft seeds for this exploration side quest. You can ask fellow community members for such seeds on Minecraft Discord servers or try one from our list of best Minecraft seeds. Not to forget, as a lot of treasure exploration is underwater, so good performance and visibility are a must in-game. Therefore, we suggest you download and install Optifine in Minecraft to get improved FPS. The treasure hunt in Minecraft is a fun adventure, but it is also time-consuming. So, do not waste another moment and get exploring! And do share your experience with us in the comments below!

If your player indicator has been close to the edge until now, you will start seeing it move towards the main part of the map. Keep moving until you are right on top of the X from every direction. The X should completely cover your player Indicator. Dig and Loot the Buried Treasure Chest Now, if you are lucky, you will find the buried treasure right below the X mark on the map. But most players have to dig the whole area around the X to find the buried treasure in Minecraft. It is mostly buried in beaches, but sometimes you might also find it under the ocean floor. Usually, it is covered by either sand or gravel blocks. It can also have stone on top of it in case of spawning into an underwater hill. On opening the chest, you will see a ton of loot. The heart of the sea is always in a buried treasure. But you can also find a lot of other items, including armors and cooked salmon to iron ingots and emeralds. You can find a complete list of possible loot items for both game editions on Minecraft Wiki. Find and Use Buried Treasure Map in Minecraft With the ability to find a Buried Treasure in Minecraft, you can take your ocean quests on a completely different level. And what better way to start one than one of our best Minecraft island seeds. These seeds spawn you on a survival island, offering you the perfect opportunity to look for buried treasures and go on sea adventures. Though, if you are running the latest Minecraft 1.18 update, digging down into some of the beautiful lush caves might be a fresher alternative. Well, at least until the Warden comes in the Minecraft 1.19 mob update to make cave exploration riskier. Coming back to the treasure, the hardest part of the process will be finding a Shipwreck with a map chest. Some players even use particular Minecraft seeds for this exploration side quest. You can ask fellow community members for such seeds on Minecraft Discord servers or try one from our list of best Minecraft seeds. Not to forget, as a lot of treasure exploration is underwater, so good performance and visibility are a must in-game. Therefore, we suggest you download and install Optifine in Minecraft to get improved FPS. The treasure hunt in Minecraft is a fun adventure, but it is also time-consuming. So, do not waste another moment and get exploring! And do share your experience with us in the comments below! Buried treasure is a loot chest in Minecraft with many rare items. From food items to tools and minerals, it has several things that can help you survive in the game. If you are planning to create a Conduit in Minecraft, you will need this chest. It is the only source of the Heart of the sea. Creating a conduit with it will give you Minecraft beacon-like powers but focus on underwater mobs. Where to Look for a Buried Treasure Map? A buried treasure is usually found on the ocean floor or buried under the beach. But, you will need a buried treasure map to locate it. You can only find the map at two rare locations. The first one is the underwater ruin, which has less than 50% chance of having the map. The second location is the shipwrecks, which, at times, contain a map chest. If there is a map chest, there will be surely a buried treasure map in it. For our tutorial, due to the higher spawn rate of map chests, we will focus on the shipwrecks instead of the underwater ruins. Find a Shipwreck As you can tell from the name, shipwrecks are damaged ship-like structures that spawn in the overworld. Unlike villages, shipwrecks are rarely generated structures. You can find them under the ocean, floating on the ocean surface, and sitting on the beaches. So, you will have to visit all oceanic Minecraft biomes until you find a shipwreck. Looking underwater is the safest bet as that is where you will most commonly find it. If the shipwreck is underwater, it will look something like the screenshot below. Underwater Shipwreck without (L) and with (R) Night Vision Yeah, some ocean biomes in Minecraft can limit your visibility, so using the Potion of Night Vision is a great workaround for finding these underwater structures. As a structure, the shipwreck is entirely made out of wood. Much like a real ship, it can have decks, masts, cabins, and even trap doors in it. But most of the time, you will not find a complete ship as a shipwreck. Most of them are missing either their front, rear, or other random parts. As mentioned earlier, finding a shipwreck in any condition is a good deal in itself. But then, you also need to hope that it has a buried treasure map onboard. Find a Map Chest In a Minecraft world, a shipwreck can have three chests at most. But only one of them will be a map chest. The map chests are located in the lower section of the shipwrecks. That means you will have to break some parts of the shipwreck before reaching the chest. If you do not find a map chest in your shipwreck, you can still go home with amazing loot from a supply or treasure chest. There is no set way to identify a map chest without opening it, but it is usually in the following situation for most shipwrecks: Top View of a Map Chest in a Shipwreck Once you find a map chest, you should look for a Buried Treasure Map in it. Every map chest in every edition of the game has it. Other than that, you can commonly find paper, feathers, and books in it. On rare occasions, you will also find a clock, compass, or a regular map in the chests. You can place the buried treasure map in your inventory and exit the shipwreck to start the search. Understand The Map To Find Buried Treasure in Minecraft Once you have the buried treasure map, make sure to place it in your active inventory  the bottom-most line in your inventory. This way, it will be visible throughout the game and accessible with ease. Then, scroll to it till your player has equipped it. You can then look at it. If you have used maps in-game before, it will look somewhat similar to this. In terms of directions, the top of the map is North and the bottom is South. Meanwhile, the left side is West and the right side is East. A white circular mark will indicate your current position on the map. And finally, the red cross or the X on the map is where the treasure is buried. To make it work, you first need to understand the directions and your position in the Minecraft world. How To Use Buried Treasure Map 1. Check the area where you are on your map, and you will understand your geographical position. As you can see, my current location on the following map is South-West. That is opposite to the X mark. So, I need to move North-East to get to the mark. 2. Next, we need to check which direction our player is facing. On the Minecraft Java Edition, you can quickly press the F3 key to open up the information panel. On the left side, you will see the direction your player is facing. If you are playing the Bedrock edition, you will have to manually try moving into random directions or use the sunrise/ sunset to determine the correct movement. Even in Minecraft, the sun rises from the East and sets in the West. 3. Next, once you know the direction you are facing in your Minecraft world, you need to move towards the ideal direction. In my case, the buried treasure is present in the North-East direction. So, I will move North first and East next once I am close to the mark. If you move in the correct direction, your map should look like the screenshot below after traveling some distance. Also, if you are close enough, you will start seeing the world forming onto the map. 4. Next, after you finish traveling in one direction and coming parallel to the X, it is time to move towards it. Now, you need to move in the next direction, which is ideally towards the X. In my case, it is the East direction.

Even in Minecraft, the sun rises from the East and sets in the West. 3. Next, once you know the direction you are facing in your Minecraft world, you need to move towards the ideal direction. In my case, the buried treasure is present in the North-East direction. So, I will move North first and East next once I am close to the mark. If you move in the correct direction, your map should look like the screenshot below after traveling some distance. Also, if you are close enough, you will start seeing the world forming onto the map. 4. Next, after you finish traveling in one direction and coming parallel to the X, it is time to move towards it. Now, you need to move in the next direction, which is ideally towards the X. In my case, it is the East direction. If your player indicator has been close to the edge until now, you will start seeing it move towards the main part of the map. Keep moving until you are right on top of the X from every direction. The X should completely cover your player Indicator. Dig and Loot the Buried Treasure Chest Now, if you are lucky, you will find the buried treasure right below the X mark on the map. But most players have to dig the whole area around the X to find the buried treasure in Minecraft. It is mostly buried in beaches, but sometimes you might also find it under the ocean floor. Usually, it is covered by either sand or gravel blocks. It can also have stone on top of it in case of spawning into an underwater hill. On opening the chest, you will see a ton of loot. The heart of the sea is always in a buried treasure. But you can also find a lot of other items, including armors and cooked salmon to iron ingots and emeralds. You can find a complete list of possible loot items for both game editions on Minecraft Wiki. Find and Use Buried Treasure Map in Minecraft With the ability to find a Buried Treasure in Minecraft, you can take your ocean quests on a completely different level. And what better way to start one than one of our best Minecraft island seeds. These seeds spawn you on a survival island, offering you the perfect opportunity to look for buried treasures and go on sea adventures. Though, if you are running the latest Minecraft 1.18 update, digging down into some of the beautiful lush caves might be a fresher alternative. Well, at least until the Warden comes in the Minecraft 1.19 mob update to make cave exploration riskier. Coming back to the treasure, the hardest part of the process will be finding a Shipwreck with a map chest. Some players even use particular Minecraft seeds for this exploration side quest. You can ask fellow community members for such seeds on Minecraft Discord servers or try one from our list of best Minecraft seeds. Not to forget, as a lot of treasure exploration is underwater, so good performance and visibility are a must in-game. Therefore, we suggest you download and install Optifine in Minecraft to get improved FPS. The treasure hunt in Minecraft is a fun adventure, but it is also time-consuming. So, do not waste another moment and get exploring! And do share your experience with us in the comments below! 1. Check the area where you are on your map, and you will understand your geographical position. As you can see, my current location on the following map is South-West. That is opposite to the X mark. So, I need to move North-East to get to the mark. 2. Next, we need to check which direction our player is facing.

                "context": "Even if you have not been following the current conversations around artificial intelligence, it is hard not to do a double take at the recent headlines warning that AI may soon represent a serious threat to human civilization. The stories revolve around recent statements made by several industry leaders, including one of AIs godfathers, that the technology is now evolving so rapidly, it could represent an extinction-level threat sooner than expected  or at least trigger societal-scale disruptions on par with the recent global pandemic. Frankly, when you are not an AI expert yourself, it can be hard to know what to make of such claims. For sure, todays incarnations of AI can do impressive things, including many things humans could never do. And as we have detailed in the past, current AI-powered technologies have a problematic track record, whether it is amplifying disinformation, perpetuating human racial biases or supercharging criminal scams. Maybe it is not so hard to believe that the machines really are about to get the better of us. Here at UM-Dearborn, we have a lot of faculty who work with artificial intelligence, so we thought it would be interesting to put the question of whether AI really is on the verge of becoming a civilization-ender to three of the universitys leaders in this area. Professor Hafiz Malik, Associate Professor Samir Rawashdeh and Assistant Professor Birhanu Eshete were all in agreement that the assertion that artificial intelligence could represent an extinction-level threat any time soon is overblown. Rawashdeh quipped that folks seem to be forgetting that we can always unplug them if they start misbehaving. Eshete generally rates todays version of artificial general intelligence as cat-level. Malik said that is not giving cats enough credit. I think when you see some of the impressive things AI can do, it can be easy to get the impression that the technology is further along than it is, Malik says. AI may be able to beat the best human chess player or diagnose illnesses doctors cannot, but he notes those are very task-specific things with strict constraints. General intelligence, the kind of intelligence that humans possess, where we can adapt to new circumstances, that is not a kind of AI I would expect to see in my lifetime, he says. And as far as the pace of advancement, I would say it has been fairly steady, not accelerating rapidly. This points to an important distinction between types of artificial intelligence that is often overlooked in the current discussions around AI. Todays AI, which is mostly driven by machine learning, is task specific. It is the technology that allows algorithms, when given enough exposure to, say, photos of cars or X-rays of a particular type of cancer, to learn the essential characteristics of those things. But artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a completely different creature. It would mean that machines could, as humans do, adapt to an almost infinite array of new tasks without being specifically trained or programmed to do those tasks. Notably, while task-specific AI is becoming ubiquitous, AGI does not exist yet. Some doubt that it is even possible. If it is achievable, there are many who think that it would not look anything like todays AI. Still, Rawashdeh, Eshete and Malik all say it would not take something as advanced as AGI to cause big problems in the human world. Rawashdeh and Eshete both voiced concerns over the fact that the highest levels of artificial intelligence are basically controlled by a handful of very large, powerful companies, which are developing the technology for commercial purposes, not to benefit human society. I think the real risk is we could very quickly become dependent on the technology in a huge range of sectors, and then we end up with systems that perpetuate inequality, Rawashdeh says. And at that point, you could imagine people saying, Well, you cannot just turn it off because it would crash the economy. Like the justification used to bailout misbehaving banks during financial crises, AI could be judged too big to fail. Disinformation is the other obvious area where we are already seeing AIs disruptive power. Disinformation, of course, is likely as old as human civilization itself. But Malik, who is an expert in deepfakes, says AI has supercharged its impacts. The polarization which we are seeing around the world, not just in the YOU.S., has a lot to do with social media platforms, which are driven by algorithms, creating echo chambers where people end up with very distorted views of reality, Malik says. Deepfakes, which he says are getting better and better every day, have only made people more vulnerable. In fact, scammers are now putting deepfake technology to use in even more clever ways. Malik says criminals can now use AI to synthesize voices in real time, complete with an array of accents, powering convincing phone scams designed to scare people into draining their bank accounts. Whether it is social media disinformation or a criminal scam, Malik says the result is a general erosion of trust in information and democratic institutions. And if we are looking for things that could legitimately contribute to an unraveling of human society, this loss of trust seems like a good place to start. Concerns over these problematic sides of AI technology have also sparked conversations about how to protect ourselves, and Eshete and Malik say the European Union has been a leader when it comes to regulation. Just this month, the European Parliament passed a draft version of the EU AI Act, which, among other things, would seriously limit the use of facial recognition software and require creators of generative AI systems like ChatGPT to be more transparent about the data used to train their programs. Here in the YOU.S., Eshete notes the White House has also released the AI Bill of Rights to help guide the design, use and deployment of automated systems to protect the American Public. Eshete says penning good regulations is complicated by the fact that there still is no consensus among AI experts on whether AGI systems have anything resembling human capabilities, or even which risks we should be most worried about. He notes it is really easy to get distracted by the frightening, future hypothetical threats of AI, like creating a lethal bio-weapon. But there are all sorts of ways AI is already impacting peoples lives. So perhaps we should focus first on what is happening right now. And then once we have done that, we will have time to look at what is coming. Eshete, Rawashdeh and Malik all say how much AI ultimately ends up reshaping our world, and whether its impacts will be beneficial or harmful, is largely up to us. Could we end up in a place where AI really does become a civilization-ender? Possibly. But if we do, we likely will not have the machines to blame."

                "context": "We encounter artificial intelligence (AI) every day. AI describes computer systems that are able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. When you search something on the internet, the top results you see are decided by AI. Any recommendations you get from your favorite shopping or streaming websites will also be based on an AI algorithm. These algorithms use your browser history to find things you might be interested in. Because targeted recommendations are not particularly exciting, science fiction prefers to depict AI as super-intelligent robots that overthrow humanity. Some people believe this scenario could one day become reality. Notable figures, including the late Stephen Hawking, have expressed fear about how future AI could threaten humanity. To address this concern we asked 11 experts in AI and Computer Science \"Is AI an existential threat to humanity?\" There was an 82 percent consensus that it is not an existential threat. Here is what we found out. The AI that currently exists is called 'narrow' or 'weak' AI. It is widely used for many applications like facial recognition, self-driving cars, and internet recommendations. It is defined as 'narrow' because these systems can only learn and perform very specific tasks. They often actually perform these tasks better than humans  famously, Deep Blue was the first AI to beat a world chess champion in 1997  however they cannot apply their learning to anything other than a very specific task (Deep Blue can only play chess). Another type of AI is called Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This is defined as AI that mimics human intelligence, including the ability to think and apply intelligence to multiple different problems. Some people believe that AGI is inevitable and will happen imminently in the next few years. Matthew O'Brien, robotics engineer from the Georgia Institute of Technology disagrees, \"the long-sought goal of a 'general AI' is not on the horizon. We simply do not know how to make a general adaptable intelligence, and it is unclear how much more progress is needed to get to that point\". Whilst it is not clear when or if AGI will come about, can we predict what threat they might pose to us humans? AGI learns from experience and data as opposed to being explicitly told what to do. This means that, when faced with a new situation it has not seen before, we may not be able to completely predict how it reacts. Dr Roman Yampolskiy, computer scientist from Louisville University also believes that \"no version of human control over AI is achievable\" as it is not possible for the AI to both be autonomous and controlled by humans. Not being able to control super-intelligent systems could be disastrous. Yingxu Wang, professor of Software and Brain Sciences from Calgary University disagrees, saying that \"professionally designed AI systems and products are well constrained by a fundamental layer of operating systems for safeguard users' interest and wellbeing, which may not be accessed or modified by the intelligent machines themselves.\" Dr O'Brien adds \"just like with other engineered systems, anything with potentially dangerous consequences would be thoroughly tested and have multiple redundant safety checks.\" Many of the experts agreed that AI could be a threat in the wrong hands. Dr George Montanez, AI expert from Harvey Mudd College highlights that \"robots and AI systems do not need to be sentient to be dangerous; they just have to be effective tools in the hands of humans who desire to hurt others. That is a threat that exists today.\" Even without malicious intent, today's AI can be threatening. For example, racial biases have been discovered in algorithms that allocate health care to patients in the US. Similar biases have been found in facial recognition software used for law enforcement. These biases have wide-ranging negative impacts despite the 'narrow' ability of the AI. AI bias comes from the data it is trained on. In the cases of racial bias, the training data was not representative of the general population. Another example happened in 2016, when an AI-based chatbox was found sending highly offensive and racist content. This was found to be because people were sending the bot offensive messages, which it learnt from. The AI that we use today is exceptionally useful for many different tasks. That does not mean it is always positive  it is a tool which, if used maliciously or incorrectly, can have negative consequences. Despite this, it currently seems to be unlikely to become an existential threat to humanity. Article based on 11 expert answers to this question: Is AI an existential threat to humanity?

                "context": "The short version of a big conversation about the dangers of emerging technology. Finding the best ways to do good. Tech superstars like Elon Musk, AI pioneers like Alan Turing, top computer scientists like Stuart Russell, and emerging-technologies researchers like Nick Bostrom have all said they think artificial intelligence will transform the world  and maybe annihilate it. Here is the argument for why we should: We have taught computers to multiply numbers, play chess, identify objects in a picture, transcribe human voices, and translate documents (though for the latter two, AI still is not as capable as an experienced human). All of these are examples of narrow AI  computer systems that are trained to perform at a human or superhuman level in one specific task. We do not yet have general AI  computer systems that can perform at a human or superhuman level across lots of different tasks. Most experts think that general AI is possible, though they disagree on when we will get there. Computers today still do not have as much power for computation as the human brain, and we have not yet explored all the possible techniques for training them. We continually discover ways we can extend our existing approaches to let computers do new, exciting, increasingly general things, like winning at open-ended war strategy games. But even if general AI is a long way off, there is a case that we should start preparing for it already. Current AI systems frequently exhibit unintended behavior. We have seen AIs that find shortcuts or even cheat rather than learn to play a game fairly, figure out ways to alter their score rather than earning points through play, and otherwise take steps we do not expect  all to meet the goal their creators set. As AI systems get more powerful, unintended behavior may become less charming and more dangerous. Experts have argued that powerful AI systems, whatever goals we give them, are likely to have certain predictable behavior patterns. They will try to accumulate more resources, which will help them achieve any goal. They will try to discourage us from shutting them off, since that would make it impossible to achieve their goals. And they will try to keep their goals stable, which means it will be hard to edit or tweak them once they are running. Even systems that do not exhibit unintended behavior now are likely to do so when they have more resources available. For all those reasons, many researchers have said AI is similar to launching a rocket. (Musk, with more of a flair for the dramatic, said it is like summoning a demon.) The core idea is that once we have a general AI, we will have few options to steer it  so all the steering work needs to be done before the AI even exists, and it is worth starting on today. The skeptical perspective here is that general AI might be so distant that our work today will not be applicable  but even the most forceful skeptics tend to agree that it is worthwhile for some research to start early, so that when it is needed, the groundwork is there.

                "context": "Yin and yang (English: /jn/, /j/), also yinyang or yin-yang, is a concept that originated in Chinese philosophy, describing opposite but interconnected, self-perpetuating cycle. Yin and yang can be thought of as complementary (rather than opposing) forces that interact to form a dynamic system in which the whole is greater than the assembled parts. The technology of yin and yang is the foundation of critical and deductive reasoning for effective differential diagnosis of disease and illnesses within Confucian influenced traditional Chinese medicine. In Chinese cosmology, the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy, organized into the cycles of yin and yang and formed into objects and lives. Yin is retractive, passive and receptive' while 'yang' is active, repelling and expansive; in principle, this dichotomy in some form, is seen in all thingspatterns of change and difference, such as seasonal cycles, evolution of the landscape over days, weeks, and eons (with the original meaning of the words being the north-facing shade and the south-facing brightness of a hill), gender (female and male), as well as the formation of the character of individuals and the grand arc of sociopolitical history in disorder and order. Taiji is a Chinese cosmological term for the \"Supreme Ultimate\" state of undifferentiated absolute and infinite potential, the oneness before duality, from which yin and yang originate. It can be contrasted with the older wuji (; 'without pole'). In the cosmology pertaining to yin and yang, the material energy which this universe was created from is known as qi. It is believed that the organization of qi in this cosmology of yin and yang has formed many things. Included among these forms are humans. Many natural dualities (such as light and dark, fire and water, expanding and contracting) are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang. This duality, as an unity of opposites, lies at the origins of many branches of classical Chinese science and philosophy, as well as being a primary guideline of traditional Chinese medicine, and a central principle of different forms of Chinese martial arts and exercise, such as baguazhang, tai chi, and qigong, as well as appearing in the pages of the I Ching. The notion of duality can be found in many areas, such as Communities of Practice. The term \"dualistic-monism\" or dialectical monism has been coined in an attempt to express this fruitful paradox of simultaneous unity and duality. According to this philosophy, everything has both yin and yang aspects (for instance, shadow cannot exist without light). Either of the two major aspects may manifest more strongly in a particular object, depending on the criterion of the observation. The yin and yang symbol (or taijitu) shows a balance between two opposites with a portion of the opposite element in each section.[citation needed] In Taoist metaphysics, distinctions between good and bad, along with other dichotomous moral judgments, are perceptual, not real; so, the duality of yin and yang is an indivisible whole. In the ethics of Confucianism on the other hand, most notably in the philosophy of Dong Zhongshu (c. 2nd century BECAUSE), a moral dimension is attached to the idea of yin and yang. The Ahom philosophy of duality of the individual self han and pu is quite similar to yin and yang of Taoism. The tradition was originated in Yunnan, China and followed by some Ahom, descendants of Dai ethnic Minority. The Chinese terms ; yn; 'dark side' and ; yng; 'light side' have a rich history in the language, their etymologies and evolution analyzable through lenses of orthography, phonology, and meanings.[citation needed] The Chinese characters  and  are both considered to be phono-semantic compounds, with semantic component  'mound', 'hill', a graphical variant of with the phonetic components ; jn (and the added semantic component ; yn; 'cloud') and ; yng. In the latter, ; yng; 'bright' features ; 'the Sun' +  + ; 'sunbeam'.[citation needed] The Standard Chinese pronunciation of  is usually the level first tone as yn with the meaning 'shady'', 'cloudy', or sometimes with the falling fourth tone as yn with the distinct meaning 'to shelter'', 'shade'. ; 'sunny' is always pronounced with the rising second tone as yng.[citation needed] Sinologists and historical linguists have reconstructed Middle Chinese pronunciations from data in the (7th century CE) Qieyun rhyme dictionary and later rhyme tables, which was subsequently used to reconstruct Old Chinese phonology from rhymes in the (11th7th centuries BCE) Shijing and phonological components of Chinese characters. Reconstructions of Old Chinese have illuminated the etymology of modern Chinese words.[citation needed] Compare these Middle Chinese and Old Chinese reconstructions of ; yn and ; yng: Schuessler gives probable Sino-Tibetan etymologies for both Chinese words. yin < *m compares with Burmese umC 'overcast', 'cloudy', Adi muk-jum 'shade', and Lepcha so'ym 'shade'; it is probably cognate with Chinese n < *m ; 'dim'', 'gloomy'' and qn < *khm ; 'blanket'. yang < *la compares with Lepcha a-l 'reflecting light', Burmese laB 'be bright' and -laB 'light'; and is perhaps cognate with Chinese chng < *k-hla ; 'prosperous'', 'bright' (compare areal words like Tai plaA1 'bright' & Proto-Viet-Muong hlaB). To this word-family, Unger (Hao-ku, 1986:34) also includes ; bng < *pl(j)a 'bright'; however Schuessler reconstructs ; bng's Old Chinese pronunciation as *bra and includes it in an Austroasiatic word family, besides ; ling < *rah ; shung < *sra 'twilight of dawn'; mng < *mra  'bright', 'become light', 'enlighten'; owing to \"the different OC initial consonant which seems to have no recognizable OC morphological function\". Yin and yang are semantically complex words. John DeFrancis's ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary gives the following translation equivalents. Yin  or   Noun:  female/passive/negative principle in nature,  Surname; Bound morpheme:  the moon,  shaded orientation,  covert; concealed; hidden,  vagina,  penis,  of the netherworld,  negative,  north side of a hill,  south bank of a river,  reverse side of a stele,  in intaglio; Stative verb:  overcast,  sinister; treacherous Yang  or   Bound morpheme:  [Chinese philosophy] male/active/positive principle in nature,  the sun,  male genitals,  in relief,  open; overt,  belonging to this world,  masculine,  south side of a hill,  north bank of a river The compound yinyang  means \"yin and yang; opposites; ancient Chinese astronomy; occult arts; astrologer; geomancer; etc.\" The sinologist Rolf Stein etymologically translates Chinese yin  \"shady side (of a mountain)\" and yang  \"sunny side (of a mountain)\" with the uncommon English geographic terms ubac \"shady side of a mountain\" and adret \"sunny side of a mountain\" (which are of French origin). Many Chinese place names or toponyms contain the word yang \"sunny side\" and a few contain yin \"shady side\". In China, as elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, sunlight comes predominantly from the south, and thus the south face of a mountain or the north bank of a river will receive more direct sunlight than the opposite side. Yang refers to the \"south side of a hill\" in Hengyang , which is south of Mount Heng  in Hunan province, and to the \"north bank of a river\" in Luoyang , which is located north of the Luo River  in Henan. Similarly, yin refers to \"north side of a hill\" in Huayin , which is north of Mount Hua  in Shaanxi province. In Japan, the characters are used in western Honshu to delineate the north-side San'in region  from the south-side San'y region , separated by the Chgoku Mountains . English yin, yang, and yin-yang are familiar loanwords of Chinese origin. The Oxford English Dictionary defines: yin (jn) Also Yin, Yn. [Chinese yn shade, feminine; the moon.] a. In Chinese philosophy, the feminine or negative principle (characterized by dark, wetness, cold, passivity, disintegration, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also attrib. or as adj., and transf. Cf. yang. b. Comb., as yin-yang, the combination or fusion of the two cosmic forces; freq. attrib., esp. as yin-yang symbol, a circle divided by an S-shaped line into a dark and a light segment, representing respectively yin and yang, each containing a 'seed' of the other. yang (j) Also Yang. [Chinese yng yang, sun, positive, male genitals.] a. In Chinese philosophy, the masculine or positive principle (characterized by light, warmth, dryness, activity, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also attrib. or as adj. Cf. yin. b. Comb.: yang-yin = yin-yang s.v. yin b. For the earliest recorded \"yin and yang\" usages, the OED cites 1671 for yin and yang, 1850 for yin-yang, and 1959 for yang-yin. In English, yang-yin (like ying-yang) occasionally occurs as a mistake or typographical error for the Chinese loanword yin-yang yet they are not equivalents. Chinese does have some yangyin collocations, such as  (lit. \"foreign silver\") \"silver coin/dollar\", but not even the most comprehensive dictionaries (e.g., the Hanyu Da Cidian) enter yangyin *. While yang and yin can occur together in context, yangyin is not synonymous with yinyang. The linguistic term \"irreversible binomial\" refers to a collocation of two words AB that cannot be idiomatically reversed as BA, for example, English cat and mouse (not *mouse and cat) and friend or foe (not *foe or friend). Similarly, the usual pattern among Chinese binomial compounds is for positive A and negative B, where the A word is dominant or privileged over B. For example, tiandi  \"heaven and earth\" and nann  \"men and women\". Yinyang meaning \"dark and light; female and male; moon and sun\", is an exception. Scholars have proposed various explanations for why yinyang violates this pattern, including \"linguistic convenience\" (it is easier to say yinyang than yangyin), the idea that \"proto-Chinese society was matriarchal\", or perhaps, since yinyang first became prominent during the late Warring States period, this term was \"purposely directed at challenging persistent cultural assumptions\". Joseph Needham discusses yin and yang together with Five Elements as part of the School of Naturalists. He says that it would be proper to begin with yin and yang before Five Elements because the former: \"lay, as it were, at a deeper level in Nature, and were the most ultimate principles of which the ancient Chinese could conceive. But it so happens that we know a good deal more about the historical origin of the Five-Element theory than about that of the yin and the yang, and it will therefore be more convenient to deal with it first.\" He then discusses Zou Yan (; 305240 BECAUSE) who is most associated with these theories. Although yin and yang are not mentioned in any of the surviving documents of Zou Yan, his school was known as the Yin Yang Jia (Yin and Yang School). Needham concludes \"There can be very little doubt that the philosophical use of the terms began about the beginning of the 4th century, and that the passages in older texts which mention this use are interpolations made later than that time.\" Yin and yang is a concept originated in ancient Chinese philosophy that describes how obviously opposite or contrary forces may create each other by their comparison and are to be seen as actually complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another. In Daoist philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in the Tao Te Ching at chapter 42. It becomes sensible from an initial quiescence or emptiness (wuji, sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until quiescence is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more.[citation needed] Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities and create and control each other. Whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.[citation needed] It is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, traditionally it is said that Yin and Yang are known by the comparison of each other, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a mutual whole (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is[citation needed] to postulate the notion of a race with only women or only men; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, women and men together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two gives birth to things, like manhood. Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the skyan intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. The growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.[citation needed] The cycles of the seasons and of plants that progresses or entropies depending on the season. In summer it seeks to procure healthier leaves, whittling (entropy) of the plant is in autumn, the degrown plants (destruction) is in winter, growth (creating) of the plant or tree during spring. Where it is gaining or progressing, fully progressed occurs during summer, summer seeks stability as it seeks to keep (progress) the leaves and branches that are healthy, growth and progress reaching its end point of a cycle. Creation as part of yang, and destruction as part of yin, progress on one side (yang) and entropy on the other side (yin), is represented in the cycles.[citation needed] Yin is the black side, and yang is the white side. Other color arrangements have included the white of yang being replaced by red. The taijitu is sometimes accompanied by other shapes, such as bagua. The relationship between yin and yang is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the 'shady place' or 'north slope') is the dark area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (literally the \"sunny place' or \"south slope\") is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was revealed.[citation needed] In turn, the concepts are also applied to the human body. In traditional Chinese medicine, one's health is directly related to the balance between yin and yang qualities within them. If yin and yang become unbalanced, one of the qualities is considered deficient or has vacuity.[citation needed] In the I Ching, originally a divination manual of the Western Zhou period (c. 1000750 BECAUSE) based on Chinese Astronomy, yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken () and yang is solid (). These are then combined into trigrams, which are more yang (e.g. ) or more yin (e.g. ) depending on the number of broken and solid lines (e.g.,  is fully yang, while  is fully yin), and trigrams are combined into hexagrams (e.g.  and ). The relative positions and numbers of yin and yang lines within the trigrams determines the meaning of a trigram, and in hexagrams the upper trigram is considered yang with respect to the lower trigram, yin, which allows for complex depictions of interrelations.[citation needed] The principle of yin and yang is represented by the Taijitu (literally \"Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate\"). The term is commonly used to mean the simple \"divided circle\" form, but may refer to any of several schematic diagrams representing these principles, such as the swastika, common to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Similar symbols have also appeared in other cultures, such as in Celtic art and Roman shield markings. In this symbol the two teardrops swirl to represent the conversion of yin to yang and yang to yin. This is seen when a ball is thrown into the air with a yang velocity then converts to a yin velocity to fall back to earth. The two teardrops are opposite in direction to each other to show that as one increases the other decreases. The dot of the opposite field in the tear drop shows that there is always yin within yang and always yang within yin. Tai chi, a form of martial art, is often described as the principles of yin and yang applied to the human body and an animal body. Wu Jianquan, a famous Chinese martial arts teacher, described tai chi (Taijiquan) as follows: Various people have offered different explanations for the name Taijiquan. Some have said:  'In terms of self-cultivation, one must train from a state of movement towards a state of stillness. Taiji comes about through the balance of yin and yang. In terms of the art of attack and defense then, in the context of the changes of full and empty, one is constantly internally latent, to not outwardly expressive, as if the yin and yang of Taiji have not yet divided apart.' Others say: 'Every movement of Taijiquan is based on circles, just like the shape of a Taijitu. Therefore, it is called Taijiquan."

                "context": "While you are probably familiar with the symbol for yin and yang, the deeper meaning of yin-yang might be new to you. Once you understand this ancient philosophy, you will start to see yin-yang in many placesand this awareness can help you live a healthier life. The theory of yin-yang is a philosophical framework that describes what Chinese people have long observed in nature and the material world. Yin-yang represents the universe creating itself from chaotic Wuji energy and transmuting it into order, or Tai Jithe great polarity. So the yin-yang symbol represents creation theory or the \"big bang.\" It begins with nothing and transforms into everything. The interdependence of yin-yang is demonstrated by the symbol's curved line. The more modern yin-yang symbol has the addition of a white and black dot, which indicates the potential for inner transformation. Yin-yang represents a dynamic balance of opposing but complementary and interconnected forces, known as chi. In short, the ancient yin-yang principle observes that in all aspects of the physical world, there is duality. Therefore, there is also an element of the nonphysical worldthat which we do not see but feel and sensethat surrounds us at all times. It is impossible to know the true origin of yin-yang, though symbols representing yin-yang were present during the Neolithic period (3400 B.C.). Yin-yang is also represented in the I Ching, or The Book of Changes, a Chinese divination text that dates back to 1000750 B.C. and is still used today. This theory appears in literature during the Yin and Zhou dynasties (1047256 B.C.), an influential time period known as the start of Confucianism and Daoism. As such, yin and yang theory is rooted in many schools of thought, and you can find examples of it everywhere. The yin aspect of yin-yang represents grounded Earth energy: It is receptive, cool, and dark and tied to the moon, the oceans, and the shade. It is associated with feminine energy. Women are associated with yin because the menstrual cycle typically lasts 28 days, like the moon cycle. In Chinese, the \"essence,\" or substance, that sparks the menses is called the Tian Gui, or heavenly water, which signals the transformation from a girl to a woman with the ability to bear children. When combined with yang, it bears the potential for life. Yin is associated with the winter season, while yang is more summer. The autumn is more yin than summer, but more yang than winter. The yang aspect of yin-yang represents the sun: It is light, expansive, and somewhat reckless at times. It is associated with masculine energy. Yin-yang is always a comparative relationship. You cannot have one without the other: Something is always more yin in comparison to yang. (It cannot be yin or yang, but yin-yang.) Yin-yang reminds us that there is a natural order to the universe, and productivity comes from harmony. When this harmony is broken, problems and diseases can occur. Here are a few examples of what can happen when yin and yang are out of balance: Yin-yang theory is represented in feng shui, the art and science of placement. Far more than a home decorating scheme, feng shui translates to wind-water, with wind representing yang and water, yin. When the elements of yin and yang are in balance in your environment, there is a good flow of chi that promotes health, wellness, and longevity. When it is out of balance, your surroundings can feel stale and uninspired. The planet is naturally in a yin-yang balance. However, as humans pollute nature and rev up the temperature of the planet, we are disrupting this balance. By destroying nature, we are in a sense destroying ourselves. We would be better off adapting our lifestyles to be in alignment with the seasons and cycles of nature, versus resisting or fighting them. The yin-yang concept is the philosophical framework of Chinese medicine, and it is discussed in The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic1, the most foundational text in Chinese medicine. All of our organs and meridians are assigned yin and yang energy. In Chinese medicine, certain illnesses are seen to be more prevalent during different seasons, corresponding with yin-yang imbalances within the body. Many facets of Western culture disrupt the balance of yin and yang, tipping the scales toward more active yang energy. Here are some ways to restore balance for the sake of your health: Staying up late and burning the candle at both ends is a very yang-weighted activity. Every time you do so, you stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, which only revs up your energy more and further perpetuates imbalance. Over time, too much yang activity interferes with the body's biological clock, or circadian rhythm, which can make you more susceptible to illness2. Stop believing the myth that productivity means constantly expanding, increasing your output, pushing your limits, and overriding your natural needs for recovery, rest, and rejuvenation. Never underestimate how important rest is for the body and mind. Exercising is a great way to stay healthy. But problems come when we sacrifice sleep to squeeze in a workout or go straight from sitting in front of a computer for hours to doing a heavy workout. These more yang approaches to exercise are counterproductive. Ultimately, they are just recipes for injury. Instead, try to work movement into your entire day and check in with what your body needs before choosing an exercise. Fat-free, sugar-free, and carb-free diets can be very extreme and limiting, and they can send some people into crisis or stress mode. A more balanced approach to dieting will look different for everyone, but you really cannot go wrong by prioritizing seasonal, minimally processed, whole-food ingredients. We become so focused on getting things done (yang energy) that we do not often allow ourselves to receive and be in the present. To find balance, block time on your schedule for activities that are more yin in nature: breaks in the day when you can eat, breathe, meditate, and re-center. Once the sun goes down, you can prioritize yin activities even more: Plan for quiet, homemade dinners featuring seasonal greens. As the sun sets, turn down the lights and switch off electronics. Get in the habit of taking relaxing baths and thinking about three things you are grateful for before going to bed (the earlier, the better!). Gratitude is the practice of receiving, and it is therefore very yin. Ending your day with gratitude will also help you stop your mental chatter and encourage restful sleep. Yin and yang is an ancient Chinese philosophy that reminds us that balance is the key to prosperity. By balancing out the opposing but complementary forces of yin and yang in our modern lives, we can achieve more vibrant and sustainable health. \"I woke up this morning and I feel much better.\" Bobbi Brown, founder Bobbi Brown Cosmetics Your FREE Astrology Sex, Love and Attraction Guide.

                "context": "Meaning, Origins, and Uses of Yin and Yang in Chinese Culture Yin and yang (or yin-yang) is a complex relational concept in Chinese culture that has developed over thousands of years. Briefly put, the meaning of yin and yang is that the universe is governed by a cosmic duality, sets of two opposing and complementing principles or cosmic energies that can be observed in nature. Generally speaking, yin is characterized as an inward energy that is feminine, still, dark, and negative. On the other hand, yang is characterized as outward energy, masculine, hot, bright, and positive. Yin and yang elements come in pairssuch as the moon and the sun, female and male, dark and bright, cold and hot, passive and active, and so onbut note that yin and yang are not static or mutually exclusive terms. While the world is composed of many different, sometimes opposing, forces, these can coexist and even complement each other. Sometimes, forces opposite in nature even rely on one another to exist. The nature of yin-yang lies in the interchange and interplay of the two components. The alternation of day and night is just such an example: there cannot be a shadow without light. The balance of yin and yang is important. If yin is stronger, yang will be weaker, and vice versa. Yin and yang can interchange under certain conditions so that they are usually not yin and yang alone. In other words, yin elements can contain certain parts of yang, and yang can have some components of yin. This balance of yin and yang is perceived to exist in everything. The yin-yang symbol (also known as the Tai Chi symbol) consists of a circle divided into two halves by a curved line. One half of the circle is black, typically representing the yin side; the other is white, for the yang side. A dot of each color is situated near the center of the other's half. The two halves are thus intertwining across a spiral-like curve that splits the whole into semicircles, and the small dots represent the idea that both sides carry the seed of the other. The white dot in the black area and the black dot in the white area connote coexistence and unity of opposites to form a whole. The curvy line signifies that there are no absolute separations between the two opposites. The yin-yang symbol, then, embodies both sides: duality, paradox, unity in diversity, change, and harmony. The concept of yin-yang has a long history. There are many written records about yin and yang, some dating back to the Yin dynasty (about 14001100 BCE) and the Western Zhou dynasty (1100771 BCE). The oldest records of the yin-yang principle are found in the Zhouyi, also called the I Ching or Book of Changes, which was written by King Wen in the 9th century BCE during the Western Zhou dynasty. The Jing portion of Zhouyi particularly talks about the flow of yin and yang in nature. The concept became increasingly popular during the Spring and Autumn Period (770476 BCE) and the Warring States Period (475221 BCE) in ancient Chinese history. The idea has influenced thousands of years of Chinese philosophers, including scholars associated with Taoism such as Lao Tzu (571447 BCE) and Confucianism such as Confucius himself (557479 BCE). It underlies Asian martial arts, medicine, science, literature, politics, daily behavior, beliefs, and intellectual pursuits. The origin of the yin-yang symbol is found in the ancient Chinese time-keeping system of using a pole to measure the changing lengths of shadows over the solar year; it was invented in China at least as long ago as 600 BCE. In fact, some have suggested that the yin-yang symbol closely approximates a graphical representation of the daily change of a pole's shadow length during the year. Yang begins at the winter solstice and indicates the beginning of the period when daylight dominates over darkness and thus is associated with the sun. The yin begins at the summer solstice and represents the dominance of darkness over daylight and is associated with the moon. Yin-yang also represents the observation of the shadow of the earth on the moon, and the record of the position of the Big Dipper constellation through the year. These observations make up the four points of the compass: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, the direction of the shortest shadow measured is south, and at night, the pole star points north. Thus, yin and yang are fundamentally connected with the annual cycle of the earth around the sun and the resulting four seasons. The principles of yin and yang are an important part of Huangdi Neijing or Yellow Emperor's Classic of Medicine. Written about 2,000 years ago, it is the earliest Chinese medical book. It is believed that to be healthy, one needs to balance the yin and yang forces within one's own body. Yin and yang are still important today in traditional Chinese medicine and Feng Shui.

In harmony, the two are depicted as the light and dark halves of a circle. The concept of yinyang is associated in Chinese thought with the idea of the Five Phases (wuxing)metal, wood, water, fire, and earthboth of these ideas lending substance to the characteristically Chinese belief in a cyclical theory of becoming and dissolution and an interdependence between the world of nature and human events. The origins of the yinyang idea are obscure but ancient. In the 3rd century bce in China, it formed the basis of an entire school of cosmology (the Yinyang school), whose main representative was Zou Yan. The significance of yinyang through the centuries has permeated every aspect of Chinese thought, influencing astrology, divination, medicine, art, and government. The concept entered Japan in early times as in-y. A government bureau existed in Japan as early as 675 ce to advise the government on divination and on control of the calendar according to in-y principles, but it later fell into disuse. In-y notions permeated every level of Japanese society and persist even into modern times, as evident in the widespread belief in lucky and unlucky days and directions and in consideration of the zodiac signs when arranging marriages."

                "context": "The principle of Yin and Yang from Chinese philosophy is that all things exist as inseparable and contradictory opposites. Examples of Yin-Yang opposite forces are female-male, dark-light, and old-young. The pairs of equal opposites both attract and complement each other. The Yin and Yang principle dates from the 3rd century BCE or even earlier. Yin and Yang is a fundamental concept in Chinese philosophy, medicine, and culture in general. As the Yin and Yang black and white circle symbol illustrates, each side has at its core an element of the other (represented by the small dots). Neither pole is superior to the other and, as an increase in one brings a corresponding decrease in the other, a correct balance between the two poles must be reached in order to achieve harmony. The concept of Yin and Yang and the idea of complementary forces became popular with the work of the Chinese school of Yinyang which studied philosophy and cosmology in the 3rd century BCE. The principal proponent of the theory was the cosmologist Zou Yan (or Tsou Yen) who believed that life went through five phases (wuxing) - fire, water, metal, wood, earth - which continuously interchanged according to the principle of Yin and Yang. Yin reaches it is height of influence with the winter solstice. Yin may also be represented by the tiger, the colour orange and a broken line in the trigrams of the I Ching (or Book of Changes). Yang reaches it is height of influence with the summer solstice. Yang may also be represented by the dragon, the colour blue and a solid line trigram. In Chinese mythology, Yin and Yang were born from chaos when the universe was first created and they are believed to exist in harmony at the centre of the Earth. During the creation, their achievement of balance in the cosmic egg allowed for the birth of Pangu (or P'an ku), the first human. In addition, the first gods Fuxi, Nuwa and Shennong were born from Yin and Yang. In Chinese religion, the Taoists favour Yin whilst Confucianists favour Yang in keeping with the prime focus of their respective philosophies. The Taoists emphasize reclusion whilst Confucianists believe in the importance of engagement in life. As expressed in the I Ching, the ever-changing relationship between the two poles is responsible for the constant flux of the universe and life in general. When there is too great an imbalance between Yin and Yang, catastrophes can occur such as floods, droughts and plagues.

                "context": "Copyright is a type of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form of expression. In copyright law, there are a lot of different types of works, including paintings, photographs, illustrations, musical compositions, sound recordings, computer programs, books, poems, blog posts, movies, architectural works, plays, and so much more! Works are original when they are independently created by a human author and have a minimal degree of creativity. Independent creation simply means that you create it yourself, without copying. The Supreme Court has said that, to be creative, a work must have a spark and modicum of creativity. There are some things, however, that are not creative, like: titles, names, short phrases, and slogans; familiar symbols or designs; mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring; and mere listings of ingredients or contents. And always keep in mind that copyright protects expression, and never ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes, concepts, principles, or discoveries. A work is fixed when it is captured (either by or under the authority of an author) in a sufficiently permanent medium such that the work can be perceived, reproduced, or communicated for more than a short time. For example, a work is fixed when you write it down or record it. Congress shall have Power . . . To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries. Copyright has been a part of YOU.S. law since the nations founding. Congress passed the first federal copyright law in 1790, and has updated it throughout the years to keep up with the times. Our copyright timeline explains more of copyrights history. Everyone is a copyright owner. Once you create an original work and fix it, like taking a photograph, writing a poem or blog, or recording a new song, you are the author and the owner. Companies, organizations, and other people besides the works creator can also be copyright owners. Copyright law allows ownership through works made for hire, which establishes that works created by an employee within the scope of employment are owned by the employer. The work made for hire doctrine also applies to certain independent contractor relationships, for certain types of commissioned works. Copyright ownership can also come from contracts like assignments or from other types of transfers like wills and bequests. YOU.S. copyright law provides copyright owners with the following exclusive rights: Copyright also provides the owner of copyright the right to authorize others to exercise these exclusive rights, subject to certain statutory limitations. The length of copyright protection depends on when a work was created. Under the current law, works created on or after January 1, 1978, have a copyright term of life of the author plus seventy years after the authors death. If the work is a joint work, the term lasts for seventy years after the last surviving authors death. For works made for hire and anonymous or pseudonymous works, copyright protection is 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter. Works created before 1978 have a different timeframe. Learn more about copyright duration in our Duration of Copyrights Circular. It is important to know that we are all also copyright users. When we read books, watch movies, listen to music, or use videogames or software, we are using copyright-protected works. So, even if you are not the owner of a work, you still may be able to use it. In addition to buying or licensing works (or some other way of seeking permission to use the work), you can also use one of the Copyright Acts exceptions and limitations, or rely on works in the public domain. The Copyright Acts exceptions and limitations found in sections 107-122 include fair use, the first sale doctrine, some reproductions by libraries and archives, certain performances and displays, broadcast programming transmissions by cable and satellite, to name a few. Interested in more information on fair use? Take a look at our Fair Use Index. The complete list of exemptions to copyright protection can be found in chapter 1 of Title 17 of the United States Code. You can also use works that are in the public domain. Works in the public domain are those that are never protected by copyright (like facts or discoveries) or works whose term of protection has ended either because it expired or the owner did not satisfy a previously required formality. Currently, all pre-1926 YOU.S. works are in the public domain because copyright protection has expired for those works. Copyright exists automatically in an original work of authorship once it is fixed, but a copyright owner can take steps to enhance the protections. The most important step is registering the work. Registering a work is not mandatory, but for YOU.S. works, registration (or refusal) is necessary to enforce the exclusive rights of copyright through litigation. Timely registration also allows copyright owners to seek certain types of monetary damages and attorney fees if there is a lawsuit, and also provide a presumption that information on the registration certificate is correct. Copyright registration also provides value to the public overall. It facilitates the licensing marketplace by allowing people to find copyright ownership information, and it provides the public with notice that someone is claiming copyright protection. It also provides a record of this nations creativity. There is only one place to register claims to copyright in the United States: the Copyright Office. For more information on registration benefits and procedures, please see our Copyright Registration Circular. Patent and trademark are other types of intellectual property that may cover works and are considered separately from copyright eligibility. For example, patents, which are granted by the government, protect certain inventions or discoveries, designs for articles of manufacture, and plant varietals. Trademark law, on the other hand, protects words, names, symbols, or devices used in trade with goods or services to indicate the source of the goods and to distinguish them from the goods or services of others. For more information on these other types of intellectual property, take a look at the United States Patent and Trademark Office's patent and trademark information. The Copyright Office also records documents related to Copyright. This is known as Recordation, and means that the Office reviews and accepts documents, and keeps a record of, the documents people provide. Recordation relates to three different kinds of documents: transfers of copyright ownership, other documents relating to a copyright, and notices of termination, which authors or their heirs use when terminating certain transfers or licenses. Statutory licenses are some of the limitations in the Copyright Act. They relate to certain uses of musical compositions, sound recordings, and cable and satellite programming. For comprehensive information on musical compositions and sound recordings, we have a number of useful resources like our Circulars and our dedicated Music Modernization Act page. For information on cable and satellite uses, visit our Licensing Division page. For more general information on copyright law, please see our Learning Engine video series.

She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate. Copyright refers to the legal right of the owner of intellectual property. In simpler terms, copyright is the right to copy. This means that the original creators of products and anyone they give authorization to are the only ones with the exclusive right to reproduce the work. Copyright law gives creators of original material the exclusive right to further use and duplicate that material for a given amount of time. Once a copyright expires, the copyrighted item becomes public domain. When someone creates a product that is viewed as original and that required significant mental activity to create, this product becomes an intellectual property that must be protected from unauthorized duplication. Examples of unique creations include: One safeguard that can be used to legally protect an original creation is copyright. Under copyright law, a work is considered original if the author created it from independent thinking void of duplication. This type of work is known as an Original Work of Authorship (OWA). Anyone with an original work of authorship automatically has the copyright to that work, preventing anyone else from using or replicating it. The copyright can be registered voluntarily by the original owner if they would like to get an upper hand in the legal system in the event that the need arises. The copyright to your original work belongs to you even if you do not register it with the government. However, you will need a registered copyright if you are bringing legal action for infringement. Not all types of work can be copyrighted. A copyright does not protect ideas, discoveries, concepts, or theories. Brand names, logos, slogans, domain names, and titles also cannot be protected under copyright law. For an original work to be copyrighted, it has to be in tangible form. This means that any speech, discoveries, musical scores, or ideas have to be written down in physical form in order to be protected by copyright. In the YOU.S., original owners are protected by copyright laws all of their lives until 70 years after their death. If the original author of the copyrighted material is a corporation, the copyright protection period is 95 years from the date of publication or 120 years, whichever expires first. YOU.S. copyright law has experienced a number of amendments and changes that have altered the duration of copyright protection. The \"life of the author plus 70 years\" protection can be attributed to the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act, (also known as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act or Sonny Bono Act), which generally increased copyright protections by 20 years. Copyright protection varies from country to country, and can stand for 50 to 100 years after the individuals death, depending on the country. While copyright law is not all-encompassing, other laws, such as patent and trademark laws, may impose additional sanctions. Although copyrights, trademarks, and patents are frequently used interchangeably, they offer different forms of protection for intellectual property. Trademark laws protect material that is used to distinguish an individuals or corporations work from another entity. These materials include words, phrases, or symbolssuch as logos, slogans, and brand nameswhich copyright laws do not cover. Patents cover inventions for a limited period of time. Patented materials include products such as industrial processes, machines, and chemical positions. A copyright protects a creator's original work from being used or duplicated without their permission. A trademark protects the reputation of a business that is associated with identifying material such as their logo or slogan. Both are ways or protecting intellectual property. Copyright exists as a right from the moment of creation. You do not need to register your original work, such as content on your website, in order for it to be your intellectual property. However, registering a copyright provides more legal protection. If you plan to bring a lawsuit against someone for infringing on your work, you will need to have a registered copyright. The cost of registering a copyright varies depending on what you are copyrighting and whether you are filing online or by paper. In the United States, the cost of copyright registration ranges from $45 to $500. Copyright law is designed to protect the creators of original material. Their copyrighted work cannot be used or duplicated without their permission. In the United States, copyright usually lasts for 70 years after the creator's death. For work to be protected under copyright law, it must be tangible as well as original. Other forms of legal protection for intellectual property also exist, such as trademarks and patents.

Copyright is a legal protection for an original work of authorship that you produce. Copyright as an intellectual property protection covers many different things, and it is important to know what is and is not able to be protected under copyright. Copyright law applies to many types of materials in business, science, education, the arts and more. In this article, we will go over what is copyright and what you can do if someone has infringed your copyright. YOU.S. copyright law applies to any work as soon as it is created and fixed in a tangible form, whether registered or not. It grants a set of exclusive rights to a works owner and protects the owner and work regarding issues of reproduction, distribution and adaptation. For actual protection of these rights in court, the creator must register work with the YOU.S. Copyright Office, which requires forms specific to the type of material being copyrighted and can incur certain fees. Copyrights are different from trademarks, which largely concern branding, and also from patents, which protect inventions. A work does not need to be published or publicly available to be subject to copyright, but it must be expressed in a discrete, tangible form and must be original. Though there are exceptions, copyright protection usually lasts for 70 years past the death of the works creator, after which the copyright is either renewed by the works successive or purchasing owner or the work enters the public domain. The YOU.S. copyright office provides six categories for types of work that can be registered for copyright: Examples from these categories include familiar types of creative works such as books, songs and paintings, though copyright can also extend to less obvious subjects such as architecture, clothing and websites. More detailed information on what material qualifies for copyright can be found in this chapter on copyrightable authorship from the YOU.S. Copyright Offices compendium of practices. An original work of authorship covered under copyright can be a film, piece of music, dance, book, design, artwork and more. It is something that you produce with a sufficient amount of creativity. Things like titles, random phrases or names cannot be copyrighted because they are not original works of authorship. To be eligible for copyright, the original work needs to be fixed. This means the work has been recorded in some way so it can be reproduced and viewed in a more permanent way. Once the work is fixed, that means you also have the right to make derivative works based on the original. You can also produce and distribute copies, such as selling T-shirts with your art on them. When you produce an original work of authorship, you are inherently the copyright owner. However, to get the legal protection of copyright, you have to register for the copyright. There is a simple application process to get a copyright, and you have to pay a small fee. If you have an original work of authorship produced after the beginning of 1978, it is eligible for current copyright law. The copyright term covers the entirety of the authors life plus 70 years after their death. If the work has more than one author, the term extends 70 years after the last surviving author dies. An original work that is work for hire or attached to a pseudonym has a different copyright period: 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation. It is important to get familiar with the copyright terms when you register for one. When you have a copyright on your original work, you can protect your work from being reproduced without permission. Many websites like Twitter and Google allow you to submit copyright claims so they are not complicit in reproducing copyrighted material. If someone is using your original words, photos, designs or something else and profiting from them, and you have a copyright, you have the legal protection on your side. You might be able to recoup lost income from someone using your copyrighted material without your permission as well. In this case, consulting a lawyer familiar with copyright and intellectual property is the best thing to do. Copyright infringement occurs when the violating party exercises any of the creators exclusive rights to the work without permission. This includes all manners of distribution (selling, broadcasting, performing, etc.), adaptation or other copying of the work. Infringement can occur whether or not the violating party seeks monetary gain through the use of the material in question, though any argument against copyright infringement is usually considered stronger without a profit motive. Copyrighted or once-copyrighted material may sometimes be used without infringement in certain situationsat least to an extent. These uses tend to fall into one or more categories: This is the most surefire way to use copyrighted material without infringement. A prospective user may find existing general licensing terms to follow or alternatively can contact the copyright owner with a request for permission. The copyright owner maintains copyright no matter what licenses he or she grants (generally or otherwise) and can base permission on certain conditions, including payment. This legal doctrine permits the use of copyrighted material under certain conditions, depending on both the nature of the original work and the nature of the secondary use. As with other aspects of copyright law, its exact scope is defined largely by judicial precedent. Unlicensed use of copyrighted material can be considered fair use if: Fair use often includes instances where copyrighted material is referenced, quoted or sampled within a larger work for the purpose of reporting, parodying or providing criticism or commentary. These are not hard and fast rules but rather established guidelines that courts will use to evaluate individual claims. A Creative Commons license is granted by a copyright owner to permit public use of a copyrighted work under specific conditions. Terms specific to the license stipulate how the material can be fairly used and for what purposes. Works in the public domain either failed to meet the requirements for protection under IP laws such as copyright, have outlived the duration of a copyright or were deliberately placed in the public domain by a works owner or creator. These works are considered to be publicly owned and fair game for use without restriction. The catch is that collections of public domain material such as a literary compilation or photo journal may themselves be subject to copyright. In order to bring a claim of copyright violation to court, a plaintiff must first have proof that they are the rightful owner of the material in questionwhich is usually supplied by their works copyright registration. They must then provide proof of actions that infringed upon rights unique to them as the copyright holder. Finally, there must also be proof the defendants actions exceed standards of fair use. A valid claim does not require proof that the plaintiff suffered monetary harm as a result of these actions. YOU.S. copyright law is based heavily on judicial precedent and case law. Enforcement is typically handled through claims brought to civil court. While states may have their own laws governing copyright, these are generally overshadowed by federal law. Copyright enforcement is easier when the plaintiff has registered the copyright shortly after its creation and when clear documentation of all other relevant information (i.e., a licensing agreement) exists. Willful infringement or an established profit motive can certainly damage a defendant in court, but neither must be proved to enforce a copyright. Creators may seek to enforce moral rights through copyright law such as the right of attribution or the right of integrity, which encompass the rights to claim authorship and prevent distortions of a work. A copyright is harder to enforce when the work in question has little to no creative or expressive element, when its secondary use is limited to a small portion of the original work or when similarities between the plaintiff and defendants works appear coincidental. Defendants in a copyright case often argue the nature of their use follows fair use standards. Otherwise, the defendant assumes the burden of proof for arguing against the copyrights validity. There are certain times when copyright issues are not addressed through a traditional federal court process. As described in the section below, online copyrighted material is routinely protected from dissemination without any litigation at all by internet service providers. For cases of infringement involving less than $30,000, the YOU.S. Copyright Office is developing a small claims process under the direction of Congress on the premise that the cost of defending a copyright in federal court can be prohibitively expensive for individuals and small businesses. This Copyright Claims Board was scheduled to begin hearing claims by the spring of 2022 but as of publication has yet to open. Courts intervene in copyright cases in several ways. One common goal of copyright litigation is an injunction preventing any further violation of a copyright by the defendant. A court can even order the seizure of infringing materials to prevent further proliferation. Plaintiffs also typically seek monetary compensation. If successful, they stand to recover for damages such as lost profits and for statutory damages of up to $30,000 if certain conditions are met. They can also be entitled to compensation for legal fees, and stand to receive significantly increased compensation if they can prove infringement was committed willfully. It is possible for certain willful infringement to even lead to criminal penalties, including up to five years of prison. The rise of the internet in recent decades has created growing challenges for the protection of intellectual property. Online content alleged to be in violation of a copyright is addressed in the YOU.S. by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA). The bill brings the United States into agreement with international copyright treaties concerning rights to digital media and other online assets. The DMCA lays out a procedure for removing online material found to be in violation of a copyright without going to court. This starts by sending a notice to the violators internet service provider (ISP) or business that hosts web pages online such as Comcast, Google, WordPress, etc. Many ISPs have their own forms for submitting a takedown request over copyright infringement, but if they do not, copyright.gov offers information on what a notice must contain. If it is not clear which an offending websites ISP is, a WHOIS search on lookup tools such as icann.org or who.is can help. Creators can also report violations to Google to combat copyrighted materials presence in search results. Even though ones work is technically protected by copyright automatically from the moment it is created, registration serves as proof and is what actually enables the copyrights enforcement in federal court. Registering a copyright before any legal action occurs, ideally within a few months of the works creation, helps its effectiveness. Putting a copyright on the public record also serves to inform other parties of ones claim, potentially dissuading them from infringement or encouraging them to seek licensing. This depends on the laws of the country in which protection is being sought. It usually comes down to the countrys level of participation in international copyright treaties or agreements, of which there are many. Most other countries also have a copyright system with automatic protection and voluntary registration. This international copyright relations resource from the YOU.S. Copyright Office offers a listing of countries relations with the United States. A trademark is another form of intellectual property applied to the representation of a brand, rather than to an individual work. Specifically, trademarks cover words and designs differentiating a brands product or service from others of its kind, such as a product name, a logo or a company slogan. Similar to copyright, trademarks do not need to be federally registered but stand to benefit from it in the event of litigation. Trademarks must be registered by a separate process with the YOU.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Learn more in our guide covering the differences between trademarks, copyrights and patents. It is simple for anyone to get a copyright. You have to submit a registration with the United States Copyright Office. There is a fee that ranges from $35 to $55 and you attach a complete copy of the work. Learn more about how to get a copyright including step-by-step instructions.

Copyright is a form of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship. In todays global digital economy, artists, authors, and companies have unprecedented opportunities to disseminate their creative works and products to a worldwide audience. They also face daunting challenges from infringement and piracy. To take advantage of these opportunities and to respond to the challenges, creators and creative industries depend more than ever on their ability to protect and enforce their copyrights. In order to understand the importance of copyright and how to protect it, it is important to examine the basics of copyright law: what it is, what it protects, and how to secure it. The primary purpose behind copyright law is to foster the creation and dissemination of works for the benefit of the public. By granting authors the exclusive right to authorize certain uses of their works, copyright provides economic incentives to create new works and to make them available in the marketplace. This overarching goal is stated in the YOU.S. Constitution, Article I section 8, clause 8, The Congress shall have Power ... To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries. This language gives Congress broad authority to advance knowledge (Science in 18th century parlance) by providing authors with certain exclusive rights over their works for limited times. The framers of the Constitution were convinced that the dissemination of knowledge was of critical importance to the new nation and that establishing a national copyright system was an efficient means to advance that goal. More than 200 years later, the purpose of YOU.S. copyright law remains fundamentally the same: to provide the economic incentives for creativity that ultimately promote the public welfare. The Supreme Court put it this way in its 1975 decision in Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken: The immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a fair return for an authors creative labor. But the ultimate aim is, by this incentive, to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good [Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 YOU.S. 151, 156 (1975)]. Copyright protects markets for American creative works not only in the United States, but also internationally. The United States is a party to several international agreements establishing minimum standards of copyright protection that member countries must adopt. These agreementswhich include the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)help to ensure that American creators have adequate legal protections against infringement of their works in foreign countries. A copyright is a federally granted property right that protects rights holders from certain unauthorized uses of their original works of authorship. The subject matter eligible for protection is set forth in the Copyright Act of 1976. Copyrightable works include literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works such as books, plays, music, lyrics, paintings, sculptures, video games, movies, sound recordings, and software. To be eligible for protection under the Copyright Act, a work must be fixed in a tangible medium of expression. A literary work, for example, can be fixed in a book or on the back of an envelope. A musical work can be fixed in sheet music, on tape, or in a digital file. A work of visual art can be fixed on a canvas, and a sculptural work in stone. Copyright protection does not extend to ideas, procedures, processes, systems, methods of operation, concepts, principles, or discoveries. Copyright protects only the expression of an idea, not the idea itself. This principle, sometimes called the idea-expression dichotomy, ensures that protection will extend only to the original elements that the author has contributed to a work, not to the works underlying ideas, which remain freely available to the public. Under the Copyright Act, a copyright owner has the exclusive right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display the work (or to authorize others to do so). In the case of sound recordings, the copyright owner has the right to perform the work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission. These exclusive rights are freely transferable, and may be licensed, sold, donated to charity, or bequeathed to heirs. The exclusive rights of copyright are limited in a number of important ways. It has long been recognized that properly crafted limitations on the exclusive rights of copyright owners help to fulfill copyrights basic goal by allowing the use of copyrighted works for certain publicly beneficial purposes. International copyright agreements to which the United States is a party set forth a number of specific exceptions and limitations that member states may recognize. Any additional exceptions or limitations must satisfy the so-called three-step test, which provides that a permitted use must (1) be limited to certain special cases, (2) not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work, and (3) not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author. YOU.S. copyright law contains numerous exceptions and limitations to the exclusive rights of copyright owners, including in the following areas: In addition, section 107 of the Copyright Act codifies the doctrine of fair use, which permits certain other uses that are not covered by a specific statutory exception. While the doctrine is flexible and case-specific, section 107 sets forth an illustrative list of the types of uses that generally are considered appropriate for a finding of fair use. These include uses for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship and research. In determining whether a particular use is a fair use, section 107 specifies four factors that courts must consider: (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. While many people believe that you must register your work with the YOU.S. Copyright Office before you can claim a copyright, no registration or other action in the Copyright Office is required to secure a copyright. A copyright is secured automatically when the work is created, as long as the work contains a sufficient degree of originality, and a work comes into being when it is fixed in a copy or a phonorecord for the first time. This is consistent with the Berne Convention, which states that the enjoyment and exercise of copyright shall not be subject to any formality. Although registration with the Copyright Office is not required to secure protection, it does provide a number of benefits: To register a claim to copyright with the YOU.S. Copyright Office, the claimant must: (1) submit a properly completed application; (2) pay a nonrefundable fee; and (3) deposit the required number of copies of the works to be registered. The international minimum standard for the protection of copyright, as set forth in the Berne Convention and the TRIPS Agreement, is the life of the author plus another 50 years. Berne Union members are free to exceed the minimum standard. The United States, the European Union, and a number of other countries have elected to do so. Under current YOU.S. law, for works created by individual authors on or after January 1, 1978, copyright protection begins with the creation of the work and lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years. For anonymous works or pseudonymous works (if the name of the author is not revealed), and for works made for hire, copyright lasts for 95 years from the date of first publication, or 120 years from the date of creation, whichever expires first. The copyright in joint works lasts for the life of the last surviving author plus 70 years. There is no such thing as an international copyright that will automatically protect an authors works in countries around the world. Instead, copyright protection is territorial in nature, which means that copyright protection depends on the national laws where protection is sought. However, most countries are members of the Berne Convention and the TRIPS Agreement, which provide important protections for foreign authors. Under these agreements, a member country generally must afford the nationals of other member states no less favorable copyright protection than it provides its own nationals. This bedrock principle of international copyright law is called national treatment. The United States Copyright Office registers copyright claims, records information about copyright ownership, provides information to the public about copyright, and assists Congress and other parts of the government on a wide range of copyright issues.

Copyright covers both published and unpublished works. Copyright, a form of intellectual property law, protects original works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software, and architecture. Copyright does not protect facts, ideas, systems, or methods of operation, although it may protect the way these things are expressed. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section \"What Works Are Protected.\" Copyright protects original works of authorship, while a patent protects inventions or discoveries. Ideas and discoveries are not protected by the copyright law, although the way in which they are expressed may be. A trademark protects words, phrases, symbols, or designs identifying the source of the goods or services of one party and distinguishing them from those of others. Your work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. No. In general, registration is voluntary. Copyright exists from the moment the work is created. You will have to register, however, if you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a YOU.S. work. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section Copyright Registration. Registration is recommended for a number of reasons. Many choose to register their works because they wish to have the facts of their copyright on the public record and have a certificate of registration. Registered works may be eligible for statutory damages and attorney's fees in successful litigation. Finally, if registration occurs within five years of publication, it is considered prima facie evidence in a court of law. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section Copyright Registration and Circular 38b, Highlights of Copyright Amendments Contained in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), on non-YOU.S. works. The practice of sending a copy of your own work to yourself is sometimes called a poor mans copyright. There is no provision in the copyright law regarding any such type of protection, and it is not a substitute for registration. The United States has copyright relations with most countries throughout the world, and as a result of these agreements, we honor each other's citizens' copyrights. However, the United States does not have such copyright relationships with every country.

One difficulty in scientifically evaluating is ghost are real is the surprisingly wide variety of phenomena attributed to ghosts. If you believe in ghosts, you are not alone. Cultures all around the world believe in spirits that survive death to live in another realm. In fact, ghosts are among the most widely believed of paranormal phenomenon: Millions of people are interested in ghosts. It is more than mere entertainment; A 2019 Ipsos poll found that 46% of Americans say they truly believe in ghosts. (The nation is discerning in its undead beliefs; only 7% of respondents said they believe in vampires). And about 18% of people say they have either seen a ghost or been in one's presence, according to a 2015 Pew Research study. Why do so many claim to have such brushes with the afterlife? \"One common because may be pareidolia, the tendency for our brains to find patterns (especially human faces and figures) amongst ambiguous stimuli,\" Stephen Hupp, clinical psychologist and professor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, Told Live Science in an email. \"One common example is when we see faces or figures in the clouds and another is when random shapes and shadows in a dark house look like a ghost,\" said Hupp, who is also the editor of Skeptical Inquirer magazine. Stephen Hupp is the editor of \"Skeptical Inquirer\" magazine. He is also a clinical psychologist and a professor of psychology at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE). He has published several books including \"Pseudoscience in Therapy\" (Cambridge University Press, 2023) and \"Investigating Pop Psychology\" (Routledge, 2022). But the idea that the dead remain with us in spirit is an ancient one, appearing in countless stories, from the Bible to \"Macbeth.\" It even spawned a folklore genre: ghost stories. Belief in ghosts is part of a larger web of related paranormal beliefs, including near-death experience, life after death, and spirit communication. The belief offers many people comfort  who does not want to believe that our beloved but deceased family members are not looking out for us, or with us in our times of need? People have tried to (or claimed to) communicate with spirits for ages; in Victorian England, for example, it was fashionable for upper-crust ladies to hold sances in their parlors after tea and crumpets with friends. Ghost clubs dedicated to searching for ghostly evidence formed at prestigious universities, including Cambridge and Oxford, and in 1882 the most prominent organization, the Society for Psychical Research, was established. A woman named Eleanor Sidgwick was an investigator (and later president) of that group, and could be considered the original female ghostbuster. In America during the late 1800s, many psychic mediums claimed to speak to the dead  but were later exposed as frauds by skeptical investigators such as Harry Houdini. Related: 10 Ghost stories that will haunt you for life It was not until recently that ghost hunting became a widespread interest around the world. Much of this is due to the hit Syfy cable TV series \"Ghost Hunters,\" which aired 230 episodes and found no good evidence for ghosts. The show spawned dozens of spinoffs and imitators, and it is not hard to see why the show is so popular: the premise is that anyone can look for ghosts. The two original stars were ordinary guys (plumbers, in fact) who decided to look for evidence of spirits. Their message: You do not need to be an egghead scientist, or even have any training in science or investigation. All you need is some free time, a dark place, and maybe a few gadgets from an electronics store. If you look long enough any unexplained light or noise might be evidence of ghosts. That vague criteria for ghostly happenings is part of the reason why myths about the afterlife are more alive than ever. One difficulty in scientifically evaluating ghosts is that a surprisingly wide variety of phenomena are attributed to ghosts, from a door closing on its own, to missing keys, to a cold area in a hallway, to a vision of a dead relative. When sociologists Dennis and Michele Waskul interviewed ghost experiencers for their book \"Ghostly Encounters: The Hauntings of Everyday Life\" (Temple University Press, 2016) they found that \"many participants were not sure that they had encountered a ghost and remained uncertain that such phenomena were even possible, simply because they did not see something that approximated the conventional image of a 'ghost.' Instead, many of our respondents were simply convinced that they had experienced something uncanny  something inexplicable, extraordinary, mysterious, or eerie.\" Thus, many people who go on record as claiming to have had a ghostly experience did not necessarily see anything that most people would recognize as a classic \"ghost,\" and in fact they may have had completely different experiences whose only common factor is that it could not be readily explained. \"There are plenty of misunderstood phenomena that influence ghost sightings. For example, sleep paralysis in a recognized experience that leads to people feeling like they have seen a ghost, demon, or alien,\" Hupp said. Personal experience is one thing, but scientific evidence is another matter. Part of the difficulty in investigating ghosts is that there is not one universally agreed-upon definition of what a ghost is. Some believe that they are spirits of the dead who for whatever reason get \"lost\" on their way to The Other Side; others claim that ghosts are instead telepathic entities projected into the world from our minds. Still others create their own special categories for different types of ghosts, such as poltergeists, residual hauntings, intelligent spirits and shadow people. Of course, it is all made up, like speculating on the different races of fairies or dragons: there are as many types of ghosts as you want there to be. There are many contradictions inherent in ideas about ghosts. For example, are ghosts material or not? Either they can move through solid objects without disturbing them, or they can slam doors shut and throw objects across the room. According to logic and the laws of physics, it is one or the other. If ghosts are human souls, why do they appear clothed and with (presumably soulless) inanimate objects like hats, canes, and dresses  not to mention the many reports of ghost trains, cars and carriages? If ghosts are the spirits of those whose deaths were unavenged, why are there unsolved murders, since ghosts are said to communicate with psychic mediums, and should be able to identify their killers for the police? The questions go on and on  just about any claim about ghosts raises logical reasons to doubt it. Ghost hunters use many creative (and dubious) methods to detect the spirits' presences, often including psychics. Virtually all ghost hunters claim to be scientific, and most give that appearance because they use high-tech scientific equipment such as Geiger counters, Electromagnetic Field (EMF) detectors, ion detectors, infrared cameras and sensitive microphones. Yet none of this equipment has ever been shown to actually detect ghosts. \"If someone hands you an electronic device to sense a ghost, then they are probably doing it to get your money during a ghost tour,\" Hupp said. For centuries, people believed that flames turned blue in the presence of ghosts. Today, few people accept that bit of lore, but it is likely that many of the signs taken as evidence by today's ghost hunters will be seen as just as wrong and antiquated centuries from now. Other researchers claim that the reason ghosts have not been proven to exist is that we simply do not have the right technology to find or detect the spirit world. But this, too, cannot be correct: Either ghosts exist and appear in our ordinary physical world (and can therefore be detected and recorded in photographs, film, video and audio recordings), or they do not. If ghosts exist and can be scientifically detected or recorded, then we should find hard evidence of that  yet we do not. If ghosts exist but cannot be scientifically detected or recorded, then all the photos, videos, audio and other recordings claimed to be evidence of ghosts cannot be ghosts. With so many basic contradictory theories  and so little science brought to bear on the topic  it is not surprising that despite the efforts of thousands of ghost hunters on television and elsewhere for decades, not a single piece of hard evidence of ghosts has been found. And, of course, with the recent development of \"ghost apps\" for smartphones, it is easier than ever to create seemingly spooky images and share them on social media, making separating fact from fiction even more difficult for ghost researchers. Most people who believe in ghosts do so because of some personal experience; they grew up in a home where the existence of (friendly) spirits was taken for granted, for example, or they had some unnerving experience on a ghost tour or local haunt. Belief in a spirit world may also fulfill a deeper psychological need. \"There is still so much to this universe that we do not understand, and it is comforting to fill in the void with explanations. Supernatural explanations are often stated with confidence, even when there is no actual evidence, and this confidence provides a false sense of actual truth,\" Hupp said. For instance, some claim that support for the existence of ghosts can be found in no less a hard science than modern physics. It is widely claimed that Albert Einstein suggested a scientific basis for the reality of ghosts, based on the First Law of Thermodynamics: If energy cannot be created or destroyed but only change form, what happens to our body's energy when we die? Could that somehow be manifested as a ghost? It seems like a reasonable assumption  until you dig into the basic physics. The answer is very simple, and not at all mysterious. After a person dies, the energy in his or her body goes where all organisms' energy goes after death: into the environment. The energy is released in the form of heat, and the body is transferred into the animals that eat us (i.e., wild animals if we are left unburied, or worms and bacteria if we are interred), and the plants that absorb us. There is no bodily \"energy\" that survives death to be detected with popular ghost-hunting devices. Related: Top 10 most famous ghosts While amateur ghost hunters like to imagine themselves on the cutting edge of ghost research, they are really engaging in what folklorists call ostension or legend tripping. It is basically a form of playacting in which people \"act out\" a legend, often involving ghosts or supernatural elements. In his book \"Aliens, Ghosts, and Cults: Legends We Live\" (University Press of Mississippi, 2003) folklorist Bill Ellis points out that ghost hunters themselves often take the search seriously and \"venture out to challenge supernatural beings, confront them in consciously dramatized form, then return to safety. ... The stated purpose of such activities is not entertainment but a sincere effort to test and define boundaries of the 'real' world.\" If ghosts are real, and are some sort of as-yet-unknown energy or entity, then their existence will (like all other scientific discoveries) be discovered and verified by scientists through controlled experiments  not by weekend ghost hunters wandering around abandoned, supposedly haunted houses in the dark late at night with cameras and flashlights. In the end (and despite mountains of ambiguous photos, sounds, and videos) the evidence for ghosts is no better today than it was a century ago. There are two possible reasons for the failure of ghost hunters to find good evidence. The first is that ghosts do not exist, and that reports of ghosts can be explained by psychology, misperceptions, mistakes and hoaxes. The second option is that ghosts do exist, but that ghost hunters do not possess the scientific tools or mindset to uncover any meaningful evidence. But ultimately, ghost hunting is not about the evidence at all (if it was, the search would have been abandoned long ago). Instead, it is about having fun with friends and family members, telling stories, and the enjoyment of pretending to search the edge of the unknown. After all, everyone loves a good ghost story.

                "context": "Here is what may explain why some people see, hear or feel a spooky presence People love scary, spooky stories of spectral phantoms. While there is no science to support the existence of ghosts, research does provide plenty of explanations for why we might genuinely sense a supernatural presence. A shadowy figure rushed through the door. It had a skeletal body, surrounded by a white, blurry aura, recalls Dom. The figure hovered and did not seem to have a face. Dom, who prefers to use only his first name, had been fast asleep. Just 15 at the time, he panicked and closed his eyes. I only saw it for a second, he recalls. Now, he is a young adult who lives in the United Kingdom. But he still remembers the experience vividly. Was the figure a ghost? In the mythology of the United States and many other Western cultures, a ghost or spirit is a dead person who interacts with the living world. In stories, a ghost may whisper or groan, because things to move or fall, mess with electronics  even appear as a shadowy, blurry or see-through figure. Ghost stories are lots of fun, especially on Halloween. But some people believe that ghosts are real. Chapman University in Orange, Calif., runs a yearly survey that asks people in the United States about their beliefs in the paranormal. In 2018, 58 percent of those polled agreed with the statement, Places can be haunted by spirits. And almost one in five people from the United States said in another survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., that they have seen or been in the presence of a ghost. On ghost-hunting TV shows, people use scientific equipment to attempt to record or measure spirit activity. And numerous creepy photos and videos make it seem like ghosts exist. However, none of these offer good evidence of ghosts. Some are hoaxes, created to fool people. The rest only prove that equipment sometimes can capture noise, images or other signals that people do not expect. Ghosts are the least likely of many possible explanations. Not only are ghosts supposed to be able to do things that science says are impossible, such as turn invisible or pass through walls, but also scientists using reliable research methods have found zero evidence that ghosts exist. What scientists have discovered, though, are lots of reasons why people might feel they have had ghostly encounters. What their data show is that you cannot always trust your eyes, ears or brain. Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He cannot move or speak or breathe deeply. He may also see, hear or feel figures or creatures that are not really there. This is called a hallucination (Huh-LU-sih-NA-shun). Sometimes, Dom hallucinated that creatures were walking or sitting on him. Other times, he heard screaming. He only saw something that one time, as a teenager. Sleep paralysis happens when the brain messes up the process of falling asleep or waking. Usually, you only start dreaming after you are fully asleep. And you stop dreaming before you waken. Sleep paralysis is like dreaming with your eyes open, explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It is called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body cannot. It is paralyzed. Most likely, that is to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.) Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it is still happening. You do not have to experience sleep paralysis to sense things that are not there. Have you ever felt your phone buzz, then checked to find there was no message? Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow? These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He is a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation. We are used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died  and trust your perceptions  then it has to be a ghost, says Smailes. That is easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you. The brain has a tough job. Information from the world bombards you as a mixed-up jumble of signals. The eyes take in color. The ears take in sounds. The skin senses pressure. The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It is so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face. The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. The vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps, explains Smailes. What you see right now is not what is actually out there in the world. It is a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that are not there. For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that was not there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.) This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably will not hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily. Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia  see faces in random shapes, for instance. In one 2018 study, Smailes team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences. For example, Do you ever see things other people cannot? and Do you ever think that everyday things look abnormal to you? Next, the participants looked at 60 images of black and white noise. For a very brief moment, another image would flash in the center of the noise. Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all  just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not. Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia. In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness. When people sense ghosts, he points out, They are often alone, in the dark and scared. If it is dark, your brain cannot get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality. The brains picture of reality sometimes includes things that are not there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading. The video shows people in white and black shirts passing a basketball. Count how many times the people in white shirts pass the ball. How many did you see? Partway through the video, a person in a gorilla suit walks through the players. Did you see it? About half of all viewers who count passes while watching the video miss the gorilla completely. If you too missed the gorilla, you experienced inattentional blindness. You were likely in a state called absorption. That is when you are so focused on a task that you tune out everything else. Memory does not work like a video camera, says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you are paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts. How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just did not notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That is a lot more likely than a ghost, French says. In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That is how much information you can hold in your memory at once. If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost. Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom does not try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, I deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping. Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, It is possible to communicate with the dead. Or Your mind or soul can leave your body and travel. The research team also looked at the students grades on a recent assignment. Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others. This study did not actually assess the students ability to think critically. That is something we would look into as a future study, says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That is probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot). Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that is a problem. If you cannot judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It is important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations. So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things. Wait, what is that behind you? (Boo!)

(in astronomy) Life on or from a distant world. colleague Someone who works with another; a co-worker or team member. culture (n. in social science) The sum total of typical behaviors and social practices of a related group of people (such as a tribe or nation). Their culture includes their beliefs, values and the symbols that they accept and/or use. Culture is passed on from generation to generation through learning. Scientists once thought culture to be exclusive to humans. Now they recognize some other animals show signs of culture as well, including dolphins and primates. engineering The field of research that uses math and science to solve practical problems. environment The sum of all of the things that exist around some organism or the process and the condition those things create. Environment may refer to the weather and ecosystem in which some animal lives, or, perhaps, the temperature and humidity (or even the placement of things in the vicinity of an item of interest). field An area of study, as in: Her field of research was biology. Also a term to describe a real-world environment in which some research is conducted, such as at sea, in a forest, on a mountaintop or on a city street. It is the opposite of an artificial setting, such as a research laboratory. hallucination A term for seeing, hearing or experiencing things that do not exist. It can occur when the brain tries to make sense of stimuli it received from various sensory organs. It can also be a side effect of some types of disease or mental illness. inattentional blindness The brains ability to ignore things occurring right before your eyes as an individual focuses intently on something else, also within the field of view. information (as opposed to data) Facts provided or trends learned about something or someone, often as a result of studying data. mentor An individual who lends his or her experience to advise someone starting out in a field. In science, teachers or researchers often mentor students or younger scientists by helping them to refine their research questions. Mentors also can offer feedback on how young investigators prepare to conduct research or interpret their data. neuroscientist Someone who studies the structure or function of the brain and other parts of the nervous system. paranormal An adjective meaning supernatural or not explainable by science. Examples include ghosts, demons, telekinesis and clairvoyance. pareidolia The phenomenon where people see a a pattern or meaning where none really exists. One example: Seeing a face when when you look at the moon. The craters that give rise to the features are in fact randomly placed. perception The state of being aware of something  or the process of becoming aware of something  through use of the senses. phenomenon Something that is surprising or unusual. physical science Fields of science (such as chemistry, physics and materials science) that deal with laws of nature and the physical attributes of systems, such as color, temperatures, winds, electricity, magnetism, speeds, energy, mass, chemical reactions, changes of state (such as solids turning into liquids or gases), and forces (such as gravity). psychology (adj. psychological ) The study of the human mind, especially in relation to actions and behavior. To do this, some perform research using animals. Scientists and mental-health professionals who work in this field are known as psychologists. random Something that occurs haphazardly or without reason, based on no intention or purpose. range The full extent or distribution of something. For instance, a plant or animals range is the area over which it naturally exists. recall (in cognition) To remember. risk The chance or mathematical likelihood that some bad thing might happen.

(For instance: Among cancer risks that the people faced were radiation and drinking water tainted with arsenic.) sequence The precise order of related things within some series. skeptical Not easily convinced; having doubts or reservations. sleep paralysis A condition that happens when the brain fails to fall asleep or wake up completely. A person in this state feels awake, but cannot move, and may hallucinate. supernatural Something that is attributed to unnatural forces, such as gods or ghosts. survey To view, examine, measure or evaluate something, often land or broad aspects of a landscape. (with people) To ask questions that glean data on the opinions, practices (such as dining or sleeping habits), knowledge or skills of a broad range of people. Researchers select the number and types of people questioned in hopes that the answers these individuals give will be representative of others who are their age, belong to the same ethnic group or live in the same region.

The list of questions that will be offered to glean those data. temporoparietal junction A region of the brain that integrates a lot of sensory information to help the body make sense of itself in terms of its surroundings. It plays a role in giving attention to details  and to spotting things that seem unusual or to deviate from the expected. United Kingdom Land encompassing the four countries of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. More than 80 percent of the United Kingdoms inhabitants live in England. Many people  including YOU.K. residents  argue whether the United Kingdom is a country or instead a confederation of four separate countries.

                "context": "Have you ever felt an unseen presence? Caught something  or someone  moving out of the corner of your eye? Walked into a cold draft in a warm room? If you have ever experienced something you just cannot explain, something that can only be described as supernatural, you are not alone. Nearly two-thirds of Americans say they have experienced a paranormal encounter of some kind, according to a 2022 YouGov poll. That includes things like hearing unexplained voices, seeing objects inexplicably move on their own, as well as other events that defy all logic. And one in five people polled claimed to have seen a spirit or a ghost. While hauntings and visits from the great beyond make for scary horror movies and ghost stories, the question \"Are ghosts real?\" is one people of almost every culture have been pondering for thousands of years, if not since the very beginning of time. To help answer it, TODAY reached out to a trio of experts including a medium, a psychic and a professor specializing in parapsychology, to share their thoughts on the spirit world, ghosts, apparitions and whether or not they really exist. And, if you are experiencing a haunting or hosting an unwanted visitor, they have got some advice that just might help. For many people, the word ghost conjures up one of two images: A menacing apparition that terrorizes unsuspecting homeowners, or a cute trick-or-treater covered in a white bed sheet. Pop-culture perceptions aside, the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a ghost as a disembodied soul, or the soul of someone who is died that either lives in the spirit world or, somehow, still exists in ours. Sherrie Dillard, medium and author of the book I am Still With You, says it is important to distinguish between ghosts and the spirits of loved ones who have passed on. Because according to Dillard, they are not the same thing. When loved ones die, she says they leave the earth and pass into a \"higher loving existence,\" whether it be heaven, \"the light\" or any other concept of the afterlife. Similar to ghosts, Dillard says that we may occasionally feel the presence of those loved ones after they are gone, whether it be in dreams, paranormal activity or other encounter. And in those instances, she says we typically have feelings of warmth, recognition or love. It does not emotionally incite, she tells TODAY.com. For most people, we do not get scared or fearful. Most of the time people will recognize, Oh, I feel like my grandmother was here, or my mother or father, or just have that feeling. Ghosts, however, are a different story. Dillard says we rarely, if ever, know who they are. Usually, it strikes us as a different energy. It strikes us as something we are not familiar with, she explains. If not acquaintances or loved ones, then...who are they? Most commonly, ghosts are human beings, people who pass over and, for various reasons, resist going into that higher level of love and resolution,\" says Dillard. She explains that one of the reasons a ghost might stick around instead of moving on to the other side is trauma. They may have been in a sudden accident, or some trauma unexpectedly, and they do not realize that they are actually passed over, she says. I know that sounds strange, but it is true. Confused or lost, the ghost lingers. What they do is they try clinging to any kind of energy source; they will cling to a house or the people in the house. Ghosts can also be attached to other physical objects, she says, including antiques or anything with a strong emotional energy. Psychic and medium Chip Coffey has appeared on more than 130 paranormal TV shows, including Kindred Spirits. And much like Dillard, he considers ghosts to be deceased people whose souls have not properly transitioned. They are kind of stuck in the middle someplace. They have remained on the third-dimension plane and, for whatever reason, they may have, they have not completed their transition into Spirit, he tells TODAY.com. Christine Simmonds-Moore, Ph.D., is a professor of psychology at the University of West Georgia who specializes in parapsychological research. According to Simmonds-Moore, ghosts are found in every single culture and have been recorded throughout history. Ghosts come from experience, she tells TODAY.com. So, human beings have had experiences with spirits  and we can be neutral on whether some of those are genuine spirits, or whether they are explained more normally. But irrespective of that, people have had experiences because it is a big part of being human. Whether those experiences are related to more earthly things like a near-death experience, loss of a loved one, or occur in an altered state such as a dream, deep relaxation or are chemically induced, in trying to understand them, they can change our perception or beliefs. From there, those beliefs can lead to other experiences, including seeing ghosts. Bottom line? If you think there are ghosts, then you are more inclined to think you have seen one. There is a whole hierarchy of different types of ghost experiences, Simmonds-Moore says, and some of them are much more easy to explain using normal psychology than others. That said, Simmonds-Moore says that there are incidences in which people have paranormal encounters and inexplicably gain access to information that they did not have access to prior to those encounters. And those are somewhat less easy to explain. Examples include things like people traveling to a location they have never been to, yet they seem to know things what they should not know, including events that occurred there or what a person they have never met was wearing, and other unexplainable circumstances. It does not mean that it is the media idea of a ghost, that there is something persisting and haunting. It could be that it is information that is tied to a place ,and some people who are in these different states are more able to notice that information and have access to than others, she says. According to Simmonds-Moore, some people believe they have had encounters with deceased loved ones, which is understandable given feelings of bereavement and loss, she says. But sometimes they might know that somebody is going to pass before they do, or they might an encounter with an apparition, and they do not know that the person has actually passed away and they see the apparition at the point of death and dying, she says. More than that, they might know how the person died even before the information has been relayed. I think that there are probably some extremely strong cases that are very rare, where you cannot always apply the normal explanation, Simmonds-Moore says. But the fact that they occur at all is interesting. So does all of this information make the case that ghosts are real? I think it is probably more like information that has aspects of somebody is life that might persist, and then other people might be able to access that field of consciousness,\" Simmonds-Moore says. Whether they exist in the traditional sense or not, Simmonds-Moore says that there are many, very rare experiences that are difficult to explain. In those cases, normal explanations do not necessarily fit. \"This implies that there are some experiences that are more intriguing, so there is a big question mark for those.\" When it is a loved one visiting us, Coffey says there are a variety of reasons to explain why they have come. Sometimes it is because they love us and they want us to understand that death is not the end, that death does not end relationships  it just alters them, changes them. Sometimes it is because we call them up and they can choose whether or not they are going to interact with us. But many times, they will willingly come through and bridge that gap where our two realms connect, he says. Ghosts, however, have a different agenda, says Dillard. Wherever there is strong emotional energy, they are attracted to it because they need a source of energy, she says. And sometimes ghosts will want to be known, they will want to be recognized, because they want our emotional reaction. Even if that reaction is stress or fear, Dillard says ghosts do not mind because one way or another, they are receiving the attention or emotional energy they are seeking. They sometimes want help, too. They will want someone to see them, know them, know there is something here and tell them where to go. In rare cases, Dillard says certain ghosts, like poltergeists, have a darker purpose and, unlike lost souls seeking direction, they gravitate toward negative energy. For instance, places with a lot of history or where bad things or traumas have occurred can attract these negative spirits. They invoke an incredible amount of fear in people for good reason. If you have got something flying across the room, it could hurt you. And they do not tend to react or respond to us in any other way than invoking fear in a negative, powerful way, she explains. Even more rare are demonic spirits like the one portrayed in the horror movie The Exorcist. But according to Dillard, they do exist. They will happen, she says. There is documented cases of things. While some people are convinced that ghosts, spirits, poltergeists or other otherworldly apparitions are real, there are, of course, skeptics. In my line of work, I get that all the time, says Dillard. I just tell people that it is fine. With things like this, we can only really believe if we have experienced them. \"We can believe it is possible, we can believe that maybe someone else may believe it. But, normally, we become true believers when we have had some form of experience. According to Coffey, he is seen far too much to not believe there is more than meets the eye. How can there be so many stories about ghosts and spirits and paranormal things and just the realm of the weird for there not to be something there? I mean, where there is smoke, there is fire. He also dismisses the idea that only certain places on earth are haunted. I think every place is haunted. Haunted is not a bad word. It is just the presence of paranormal or spiritual activity, he says. There can be the 'mom-and-pop' garden variety, non-malicious, non-malevolent haunting. Absolutely. A lot of people have died throughout history. There are a lot of dead people out there. So, haunted? You have probably got spirits floating in this space right here. Most places have spirit activity, Coffey explains. For the average person, however, a ghost encounter, whether benign or not, can be pretty unsettling, if not downright scary. If you believe it is happening to you, Dillard suggests firmly, but kindly, telling them to leave. You can send a thought message, you can send a verbal message, she says. And that is: You do not belong here. You are no longer in the physical world, and there is a better place for you. And in most cases, she says that it is enough. When it is not, then it might be time to enlist the help of an expert. If you have a malicious or malevolent haunting, that is when you have to call in the troops and get the help you need in trying to expel it, says Coffey.

                "context": "By Barry Markovsky, Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Sociology, University of South Carolina October 30, 2023 A significant proportion of Americans believe in ghosts, with many claiming personal encounters. However, despite the prevalence of recording devices, concrete evidence for the existence of ghosts remains elusive. Certainly, lots of people believe in ghosts  a spirit left behind after someone who was alive has died. In a 2021 poll of 1,000 American adults, 41% said they believe in ghosts, and 20% said they had personally experienced them. If they are right, that is more than 50 million spirit encounters in the YOU.S. alone. That includes the owner of a retail shop near my home who believes his place is haunted. When I asked what most convinced him of this, he sent me dozens of eerie security camera video clips. He also brought in ghost hunters who reinforced his suspicions. Some of the videos show small orbs of light gliding around the room. In others, you can hear faint voices and loud bumping sounds when nobodys there. Others show a book flying off a desk and products jumping off a shelf. Many ghostly encounters are due to the way your brain interprets certain sights and sounds. It is not uncommon for me to hear stories like this. As a sociologist, some of my work looks at beliefs in things like ghosts, aliens, pyramid power, and superstitions. Along with others who practice scientific skepticism, I keep an open mind while maintaining that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Tell me you had a burger for lunch, and I will take your word for it. Tell me you shared your fries with Abraham Lincolns ghost, and I will want more evidence. In the spirit of critical thinking, consider the following three questions: People may think they are experiencing ghosts when they hear strange voices, see moving objects, witness balls or wisps of light, or even translucent people. Yet no one describes ghosts as aging, eating, breathing, or using bathrooms  despite plumbers receiving many calls about toilets ghost-flushing. So could ghosts be made of a special kind of energy that hovers and flies without dissipating? If that is the case, that means when ghosts glow, move objects, and make sounds, they are acting like matter  something that takes up space and has mass, like wood, water, plants, and people. Conversely, when passing through walls or vanishing, they must not act like matter. But centuries of physics research have found nothing like this exists, which is why physicists say ghosts cannot exist. And so far, there is no proof that any part of a person can continue on after death. The real truth is out there, says this ghost skeptic. Never before in history have people recorded so many ghost encounters, thanks in part to mobile phone cameras and microphones. It seems there would be great evidence by now. But scientists do not have it. Instead, there are lots of ambiguous recordings sabotaged by bad lighting and faulty equipment. But popular television shows on ghost hunting convince many viewers that blurry images and emotional reactions are proof enough. As for all the devices ghost hunters use to capture sounds, electrical fields and infrared radiation  they may look scientific, but they are not. Measurements are worthless without some knowledge of the thing you are measuring. When ghost hunters descend on an allegedly haunted location for a night of meandering and measurement, they usually find something they later deem paranormal. It may be a moving door (breeze?), a chill (gap in the floorboards?), a glow (light entering from outside?), electrical fluctuations (old wiring?), or bumps and faint voices (crew in other rooms?). Whatever happens, ghost hunters will draw a bulls-eye around it, interpret that as evidence and investigate no further. There is a scientific explanation for spooky sightings. Personal experiences with ghosts can be misleading due to the limitations of human senses. That is why anecdotes cannot substitute for objective research. Alleged hauntings usually have plenty of non-ghostly explanations. One example is that retail establishment in my neighborhood. I reviewed the security camera clips and gathered information about the stores location and layout, and the exact equipment used in the recordings. First, the orbs: Videos captured many small globes of light seemingly moving around the room. In reality, the orbs are tiny particles of dust wafting close to the camera lens, made to bloom by the cameras infrared lights. That they appear to float around the room is an optical illusion. Watch any orb video closely and you will see they never go behind objects in the room. That is exactly what you would expect with dust particles close to the camera lens. Next, voices and bumps: The shop is in a busy corner mini-mall. Three walls abut sidewalks, loading zones and parking areas; an adjacent store shares the fourth. The security camera mics probably recorded sounds from outdoors, other rooms and the adjacent unit. The owner never checked for these possibilities. Then, the flying objects: The video shows objects falling off the showroom wall. The shelf rests on adjustable brackets, one of which was not fully seated in its slot. The weight of the shelf caused the bracket to settle into place with a visible jerk. This movement sent some items tumbling off the shelf. Then, the flying book: I used a simple trick to recreate the event at home: a hidden string taped inside a books cover, wrapped around the kitchen island, and tugged by my right hand out of camera range. Experience the mystery of the flying book. Now I cannot prove there was not a ghost in the original video. The point is to provide a more plausible explanation than it must have been a ghost. One final consideration: Virtually all ghostly experiences involve impediments to making accurate perceptions and judgments  bad lighting, emotional arousal, sleep phenomena, social influences, culture, a misunderstanding of how recording devices work, and the prior beliefs and personality traits of those who claim to see ghosts. All of these hold the potential to induce unforgettable ghostly encounters. But all can be explained without ghosts being real. Written by Barry Markovsky, Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Sociology, University of South Carolina. Adapted from an article originally published in The Conversation. No. There are many, many other energy phenomenon that can have ghost-like qualities, but are not spirits of dead people. There are non-corporeal beings, but they are not ghosts. THAT is a whole other topic. A rather interesting article, however, I did not see much in the authors very short bio that they would know anything more about the phenomenon than anyone else would, however, I was reading about brains and frequencies not long ago and from personal experience I know that at least some of those transmitted signals that are essential for a mind to even function travel a lot further than from one side of the brain to the other side. On the other hand, we all know about narrative control and censorship; it is not new, it is been going on for thousands of years; we all know that brain waves are being used to aid some handicapped individuals and other uses. In the field of quantum physics we know time that for at least photons time travel is possible, and several such time machines have in fact been constructed. In the field of the paranormal there is the subject of what is called astral projection, which, from descriptions that I have read from individuals acclimated in Western Culture, few if any of those individuals have actually consciously achieved the feat, that they claim to have achieved, however, I apparently,witnessed, the apperation of a dog that I knew had died several weeks earlier. How would that even be possible? Well, it is called criminal behavior by people who hijack natural phenomenon and make religions of them, for which we see in action even today in the genocide being perpetrated in the Middle East. These sorts of human behavior are the very sort of activities that prevent humans from evolving beyond the intelligence of a slime cell. To put it simplely, just reading the sort of articles that one finds in science journals reveals intense criminal and political motivations to hinder science research, and even if it did, anything good that might come out of it would be subverted to commit evil, as we saw with the whole covid-19 narrative.
