            Shotguns typically have a shorter range than other types of firearms such as rifles or pistols because of
            their
            design and the ammunition they use. Shotguns are designed to fire a cluster of pellets rather than a single
            bullet, and the pellets spread out as they travel, making them more effective at close ranges. The
            ammunition
            used in shotguns is also typically <span

                style='color: red; text-decoration: line-through;'>larger and heavier</span> than other types of
            ammunition,
            which means it loses velocity more quickly and is less accurate over longer distances. Additionally, the
            shorter
            barrels on shotguns also contribute to shorter range as they are less effective at stabilizing the pellets
            as
            they travel.</div>

            Non-Banking Financial Organizations (NBFCs) are financial institutions that provide banking and financial
            services without holding a banking license. They offer services such as loans, credit facilities, <span
                style='background-color: #E9A2D9; border-bottom: 1px dotted;'>entity</span><span
                style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'> microfinance </span><span
                style='color: red; text-decoration: line-through;'>asset financing</span>, investment advice, and more.
            NBFCs play a crucial role in the financial sector by catering to individuals, small businesses, and sectors
            that
            may have limited access to traditional banking services. They are regulated by financial authorities to
            ensure
            compliance with regulations and protect the interests of customers. Please note that while NBFCs operate
            similarly to banks, there may be differences in their specific services, regulations, and risk profiles. It
            is
            important to carefully evaluate and understand the terms and conditions when engaging with any financial
            institution, including NBFCs.</div>

            The term "feminism" refers to a social, political, and cultural movement that advocates for the rights and
            equality of all genders. Feminism seeks to challenge and dismantle systems of patriarchy and gender
            inequality
            that have historically marginalized and oppressed women and other marginalized groups. Feminism as a
            movement
            has evolved over time and encompasses a wide range of perspectives and approaches, but at its core, it is
            about
            promoting gender equality and fighting against discrimination and oppression based on gender. Feminists work
            to
            raise awareness of issues such as gender-based violence, reproductive rights, workplace discrimination, and
            pay
            equity, among other things.</div>


        <div style="font-weight: normal;">\n Yes, I am familiar with the concept of Yin and Yang. Yin and Yang are
            fundamental concepts in Chinese philosophy and represent complementary and interconnected forces or energies
            that exist in everything. They are opposite but interdependent, and they provide a way of understanding the
            dynamic and harmonious balance of the universe. Yin is associated with qualities such as darkness,
            femininity,
            passivity, coldness, and water. It represents the receptive, intuitive, and nurturing aspects of life. Yang,
            on
            the other hand, is associated with qualities such as light, masculinity, activity, heat, and fire. It
            represents
            the assertive, active, and transformative aspects of life. The concept of Yin and Yang emphasizes the
            interplay
            and interconnectedness of these opposing forces. It suggests that all phenomena in the universe, including
            natural and human aspects, are a combination of Yin and Yang energies. Moreover, Yin and Yang are not
            absolute,
            but rather relative and constantly changing. The balance between Yin and Yang is considered essential for
            harmony and well-being. <span

                style='color: red; text-decoration: line-through;'>In practice, Yin and Yang are often depicted as a
                circular symbol called the Taijitu or Yin-Yang symbol, where the white area represents Yang and the
                black
                area represents Yin. The small dots within each area indicate that there is always a seed of one within
                the
                other, representing their interdependence and dynamic nature.</span> The concept of Yin and Yang has
            profound implications across various domains, including traditional Chinese medicine, philosophy, martial
            arts,
            and Feng Shui, and it continues to be influential in understanding the balance and interconnectedness of the
            world.</div>
