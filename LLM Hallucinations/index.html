        Shotguns typically have a shorter range than other types of firearms such as rifles or pistols because of their
        design and the ammunition they use. Shotguns are designed to fire a cluster of pellets rather than a single
        bullet, and the pellets spread out as they travel, making them more effective at close ranges. The ammunition
        used in shotguns is also typically <span

        which means it loses velocity more quickly and is less accurate over longer distances. Additionally, the shorter
        barrels on shotguns also contribute to shorter range as they are less effective at stabilizing the pellets as
        they travel.</div>
