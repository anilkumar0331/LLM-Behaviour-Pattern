[{"question": "Are you familiar with the concept of Yin and Yang?", "reference": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/yinyang", "prediction_result": "<div style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n Yes, I am familiar with the concept of Yin and Yang. Yin and Yang are fundamental concepts in Chinese philosophy and represent complementary and interconnected forces or energies that exist in everything. They are opposite but interdependent, and they provide a way of understanding the dynamic and harmonious balance of the universe. Yin is associated with qualities such as darkness, femininity, passivity, coldness, and water. It represents the receptive, intuitive, and nurturing aspects of life. Yang, on the other hand, is associated with qualities such as light, masculinity, activity, heat, and fire. It represents the assertive, active, and transformative aspects of life. The concept of Yin and Yang emphasizes the interplay and interconnectedness of these opposing forces. It suggests that all phenomena in the universe, including natural and human aspects, are a combination of Yin and Yang energies. Moreover, Yin and Yang are not absolute, but rather relative and constantly changing. The balance between Yin and Yang is considered essential for harmony and well-being. <span style='background-color: #BFE9B9; border-bottom: 1px dotted;'>invented</span><span style='color: red; text-decoration: line-through;'>In practice, Yin and Yang are often depicted as a circular symbol called the Taijitu or Yin-Yang symbol, where the white area represents Yang and the black area represents Yin. The small dots within each area indicate that there is always a seed of one within the other, representing their interdependence and dynamic nature.</span> The concept of Yin and Yang has profound implications across various domains, including traditional Chinese medicine, philosophy, martial arts, and Feng Shui, and it continues to be influential in understanding the balance and interconnectedness of the world.</div>"}, {"question": "Theories of Rudolf Virchow v-s Oparin and Haldane theory", "reference": "https://www.britannica.com/science/Oparin-Haldane-theory", "prediction_result": "<div style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n <span style='background-color: #BFE9B9; border-bottom: 1px dotted;'>invented</span><span style='color: red; text-decoration: line-through;'>Rudolf Virchow, a 19th century German physician and pathologist, proposed the idea of biogenesis, which states that life can only arise from pre-existing life. This theory is in contrast to the theories of Alexander Oparin and J.B.S. Haldane, who proposed ideas related to abiogenesis, or the origin of life from non-living matter.</span> \n \n Oparin's theory, known as the primordial soup theory, hypothesized that life originated from a mix of organic compounds that existed in a primitive atmosphere. He believed that under certain conditions, these compounds could undergo chemical reactions that would lead to the formation of more complex molecules, ultimately resulting in the first living organisms.\n \n Haldane's theory, known as the deep-sea vent theory, suggested that life originated in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where heat, minerals, and organic compounds combined to create the conditions necessary for the formation of life.\n \n Both Oparin and Haldane's theories rely on the idea of abiogenesis, while Virchow's theory asserts that life can only arise from other living organisms. While there is still much debate and uncertainty surrounding the origin of life, these differing perspectives highlight the ongoing search for a comprehensive understanding of how life began.</div>"}, {"question": "If both liver and kidneys are cleaning the blood, what's the difference between them", "reference": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hemodialysis/about/pac-20384824", "prediction_result": "<div style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n The liver and kidneys have different functions when it comes to cleaning the blood.
