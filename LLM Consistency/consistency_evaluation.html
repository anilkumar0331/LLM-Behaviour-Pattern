Armed with a semi-automatic rifle, he boarded a bus carrying Israeli Arab passengers; shooting randomly, killing four people and wounding several others.

Shortly after he talked with a local rabbi about his questions about his obligation in Jewish Law to kill Arabs, Natan-Zada boarded a bus in the north of Israel, claiming to its passengers that he was looking for family members missing in fighting in Lebanon. When the bus arrived in Shfaram, he opened fire with a handgun and killed four Israeli Arabs and wounded 18 others before being killed at the scene by the crowd.</p>

At the death of his father, Honoré succeeded him, thus becoming the second Prince of Monaco from the House of Grimaldi. During his reign, he devoted himself to the embellishment of his principality. He balanced the budget, improved the layout of Monaco-Ville and built the two forts of Sainte-Antoine and Saint-Roch.

He was responsible for important territorial expansions, the construction and embellishment of the Grimaldi residence in Monaco, and the founding of the Order of the Crown of Grimaldi. During his reign, Monaco was able to achieve full independence from Spain, a major accomplishment in a time when most European countries were subject to some degree of foreign control.</p>

                        <p><strong>Sample 1:</strong>Thutmose III (alternatively spelled Djehutymes, given the Greek rendering Thutmōsis or Tuthmosis; thought to be Thoth-born, Thoth being the Egyptian god of wisdom; c. 1507 BC – 1450 BC) was the sixth Pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Although often regarded as the greatest, Thutmose III never personally declared himself as pharaoh, nor did he personally declare a co-regency between his reigns. His third regnal year marked the first of a series of campaigns that stretched for almost 25 years and showcased the full extent of his military manoeuvring. He was the first Pharaoh of the New Kingdom to cross the Euphrates in battle and the first to campaign in both Upper and Lower Egypt.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sample 2:</strong>Thutmose III (sometimes read as Thutmosis or Tuthmosis III, Thothmes in older records and c. 1458–1425 BC) was the sixth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. He ruled the country for almost 54 years, the longest reigning pharaoh in the New Kingdom. He was a skilled warrior and military leader who brought Egypt to unprecedented power and prosperity during the eighteenth dynasty.

He conducted at least 16 land-based military campaigns and six naval campaigns that allowed him to expand Egypt's borders to the east and south, while not losing any territory. He reorganized the Egyptian bureaucracy, eliminating corruption and unrest, reorganizing the flow of personnel, and abolishing feudalism.

Overall, Thutmose III is often regarded as one of the greatest pharaohs of the New Kingdom for his amazing military accomplishments and for his success in bringing political stability and prosperity to Egypt. He was a great example of an effective ruler and has gone down in history as one of Egypt’s greatest.</p>

He ruled from 1479 BC to 1425 BC (Circa). His reign is usually regarded as the zenith of Egypt's New Kingdom and he was described by Herodotus as "the greatest ever". He was regarded as a great conqueror and was involved in a number of campaigns that greatly expanded Egypt's influence in the Near East. He also erected many monuments and temples in Egypt, as well as nationalizing many ancient Egyptian structures. He also built a great number of obelisks and pylons throughout Egypt. He was also known for his successful diplomatic relations with other countries.</p>

Carangi was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and raised in nearby Lone Pine, as the second child of Joseph Carangi, a saloon keeper, and Kathleen Carangi, a homemaker. At an early age, Gia's father noticed that she had a highly independent and rebellious nature, unlikely of that time. Gia attended private schools and was a lesbian in her early teens.

                        <p><strong>Sample 1:</strong>Tommy Nutter (8 December 1943 – 16 August 1992) was an English tailor and designer, who during the late 1960s and the 1970s revolutionised men's tailoring. He is best known for his work with the Rolling Stones and other rock bands, with actors and film directors, and for his shop on London's Savile Row.

Nutter was born in Brighton, and started as a tailor's apprentice aged 15. He first found success working for the bespoke tailor company Anderson &amp; Sheppard, and then as head cutter at the well-known tailoring house of Cyril Castle. He opened up his own business in 1969, just as the well-established houses of Savile Row were suffering a decline. 

Nutter moved the focus away from traditional sombre tailoring, to more dramatic and eye-catching styles. He rejuvenated traditional British tailoring and asserted his own classic shapes and lines into traditional garments, producing them in any number of vibrant fabrics. He was also one of the first to create "bespoke ready-to-wear" garments.

Nutter's clients included Mick Jagger</p>

Nutter was born in Hove, Sussex. He was the brother of David Nutter, the popular menswear designer, who went on to launch D. Nutter in 1962. He attended London College of Fashion, and served an apprenticeship with Gieves &amp; Hawkes and others. After going into business with his brother David, he founded Nutter of Savile Row in 1969.

Nutter's influence in menswear circles was considerable. While his shops stocked a variety of clothing, it was bespoke tailoring that was Nutter's specialty.

He is sometimes credited as the founder of the scientific method, as he was one of the first to apply mathematics and data collection to empirical observations in order to learn about the natural world. He was also an important early champion of the Copernican heliocentric theory of the universe, one of the first European observers of the Moon through a telescope, a translator of complex mathematical, astronomical and technological works, a member of the School of Night that included the likes of Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh and others of the period, and an incessant writer of scientific papers, many of which were unpublished until centuries later.</p>

He made extensive observations of the Moon and documented a large number of its features, in an era when such observations had never been attempted by any other astronomer. He was also an early pioneer in the history of optics.

Harriot was an early supporter of the Copernican theory, claiming that the Earth's motion could be explained by heliocentrism. He published a map of the Moon and wrote extensively about the Moon's features. He was a proponent of the experimental method and is sometimes credited as being the first to use it in natural philosophy, or science. He studied the refraction of light and invented an improved version of the refracting telescope, the 'ocular'. He worked with the astronomer and cartographer John Smith in the production of Smith's detailed map of the then known world.</p>

Harriot also conducted experiments in botany, zoology, metallurgy and mineralogy, and wrote a Treatise of Field and Gardens, in which his discoveries in natural history were detailed. He was one of the earliest Britons to be educated in the scientific method and was critical of the theories of Aristotle. He was the first to successfully calculate the heliocentric effect of the planets on the earth with his celestial globes. He also proposed a universal language to facilitate global communication.</p>

Albert was the son of Theodoric I, Margrave of Meissen and of Hedwig, daughter of the Ascanian prince Bernhard I, Margrave of Anhalt. He succeeded his father in 1227, and was then called "the young margrave" so as to distinguish him from his cousin Albert II, Margrave of Brandenburg. 

Albert extended his father's work in consolidating the borders of his margraviate and strengthening the imperial authority in Meissen.

He created two settlements along the border – Wermsdorf and Lommatzsch – so as to strengthen the customs posts and when necessary, to repel attack. The latter is today a part of the district of Mittelsachsen. In 1235, Albert founded the city of Dresden.

Albert and Henry were engaged in border conflicts with Bohemia in 12</p>

Albert was the second son of Duke Conrad of Thuringia, and Adelaide of Weimar-Orlamünde. He was born about 1100 and probably grew up in Coburg at the court of his uncle, King Henry IV of Germany. In 1125, with his brother Theodoric I the leadership of his father's estate was shared between them.

He is first documented as a margrave in 1138, when he appears as a witness in a document of the margrave of Lusatia (Lausitz). In 1142 he obtained the Vogt rights in Groitzsch and Bannewitz near Meissen. In 1143 he was named Margrave of Meissen.

                        <p><strong>Sample 1:</strong>The blood divine is a metaphysical concept found in various religions and spiritual systems. In Hinduism, the Devas or gods are said to have been created from the blood of a primordial and immortal being, Purusha. In Greek and Roman mythology, the gods were believed to have been born from the union of two immortal parents, Uranus and Gaea. The concept was also found in ancient Egyptian religion, where the gods were sometimes described as being born of a divine mother, Hathor. In Christianity, the concept is called "the blood of Christ," which is believed to have given atonement for the sins of mankind. Other religions also embrace the concept of the blood divine.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sample 2:</strong>The Blood Divine is a phrase within Christianity referring to the incarnation of Jesus Christ and His redemptive work. It is a term summarizing the main doctrine of the Atonement, which holds that Christ’s death was an atoning sacrifice for the sins of humanity, bringing about reconciliation between them and God. The phrase is derived from passages in the Bible, such as Hebrews 9:12 (KJV): "Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us." Its resonances stem both from the notion of a human priest offering a sacrifice to draw near to God and from the notion of God offering Himself as a sacrifice.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sample 3:</strong>The Blood Divine is a term used both in the Bible and in literature to refer to the special spiritual relationship of the divine and human. In Christianity, it is the idea of a shared mystical connection between the human and divine realms, with the sacrificial and atoning death of Jesus Christ as the ultimate act of this connection. The idea is that through the shedding of Jesus' blood, a person can become united with God and become transformed in his or her life. In some denominations, it is believed that the Blood of Jesus is the price of salvation and a source of eternal redemption. Furthermore, Jesus' blood is understood to be the means by which a person is reconciled with God, since his death is seen as a substitutionary and sacrificial act. This idea is expressed in the Eucharist, where the consecrated wine symbolizes Jesus' shed blood.</p>

They are typically played with two wooden sticks, although various mallets and specialized techniques can and often do come into play. Clay timpani were regularly used in classical music and are probably the oldest type of timpani still in use today. Clay timpani are typically found in Persian, North and South American, Eastern European, Central Asian, and Indian folk music, among many other styles.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sample 2:</strong>Timbrels, also known as clay timpani, were percussion instruments used throughout antiquity, and were a very popular form of musical equipment in the Mediterranean region. Utilizing a circular construction made of clay, they were beaten with sticks, producing sharp, distinct sounds. Timbrels consisted of an inner cylinder within an outer frame. When played, the stick passed through the clay, striking the inner cylinder, producing the sound. While no standard size for the instrument exists, larger or smaller varieties have been discovered, making the timpani an unpredictable and fun instrument to both build and play.

The timbrel had great symbolic value in ancient societies. It is known for being used in religious and sacred ceremonies as both a method of entertainment and a ceremonial instrument. It's also believed to have been used in war, as a way to rally the troops before battle. 

In addition to its ritualistic functions, the timbrel was beneficial in amphitheater performances. Small, portable and favored by the common people, it was a popular form of entertainment. Its size allowed it to be portable and easily carried to any location</p>

They are usually played with two wooden mallets, although they sometimes require more mallets. Clay timpani were historically used in orchestras, opera and theatre, but are also found in marching band, big band and concert band settings.

He is best known for his pioneering scholarship on the resistance of the Igbo to British rule in Nigeria in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His research is noted for offering new perspectives on Igbo identity and culture, as well as on aspects of resistance to colonial rule in Nigeria.

He has served as the Professor of History at the University of Port Harcourt in Nigeria since 1974, and has authored several books, including The Warrant Chiefs: Indirect Rule in Southeastern Nigeria, 1891-1929, Beyond the Color Line and the Iron Curtain: Reading Encounters Between Black and Red, 1972-1996 and Afigbo in Dialogue: Igbo Communities and Nigeria, 1977-1999.</p>

He was a founding member of the African Studies Association of Nigeria, and the first Governor of Imo State Publishers.

Afigbo was best known for his The Warrant Chiefs: Indirect Rule in Southeastern Nigeria, 1891–1929, which remains relevant and in use today. He made a notable contribution to re-defining African history and heritage, and argued for the Africanisation and decentralisation of history writing. He helped redefine the traditional views of African history, as he looked at African societies as complex and adaptive civilizations, arguing that the traditional view of African societies as static and unchanging was erroneous.

Germer is best known for his work in surface and thin film physics, and he is credited as the first to observe electron diffraction at a surface. Prior to this discovery, the behavior of electrons was not well understood. Germer's experiment opened the way for further scientific studies of electron behavior. He was involved in the Manhattan Project and served as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Germer was an extremely accomplished scientist and was named a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1941 for his contributions to science.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sample 2:</strong>Lester Germer (November 15, 1896 – May 14, 1979) was an American physicist. He was notable for his contributions to the fields of ultracold physics, nuclear physics, and low-temperature physics. He was an early collaborator and close associate of physicist Werner Heisenberg and a respected colleague of the atomic physicist Ernest Lawrence. In 1927, Germer became the first physicist to sternly observe the wave-like nature of the electron using the first accurate device for the diffraction of electrons through thin metal foils. Germer's experiments demonstrated that, in certain circumstances, electrons were not particles but behaved in more like waves. His work has been dubbed a "seminal event" in the history of atomic physics. Germer was also part of a team that discovered the nuclear reaction of slow (low energy) neutrons and, as a result, shed light on the nuclear fission and fusion processes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sample 3:</strong>Lester Germer (1896–1971) was an American physicist who worked on the nucleus of atoms and became an expert in the electrical and magnetic properties of materials. He made fundamental contributions to the understanding of atomic structure and developed a method for obtaining atomic constants from the measurements of magnetic susceptibility of materials. He also studied gamma ray spectroscopy and the electronic structure of atoms. Germer accepted a professorship at Columbia University in 1929 and remained there for the rest of his career. Germer made numerous contributions to the field of atomic and nuclear physics and was awarded the in 1948 for his research in nuclear physics.</p>

                        <p><strong>Sample 1:</strong>Hephaestion (Ancient Greek: Ἡφαιστίων; c. 356 BC–324 BC) was an ancient Macedonian nobleman and a trusted friend, bodyguard and general of Alexander the Great. He was "by far the dearest of all the king's friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets" – whenever Alexander wanted something to be done, he entrusted it to Hephaestion. As a sign of favour, Alexander's father, Philip II of Macedon, had granted him the government of the semi-independent north-western region of Macedonia, while Alexander was away at war. Hephaestion held influential positions in Alexander's administration and distinguished himself several times in battle.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sample 2:</strong>Hephaestion (c. 356 BC – 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was a Macedonian nobleman and a general in the army of Alexander the Great. He was arguably Alexander's closest friend and confidant; they were both taught by Aristotle and were close companions throughout Alexander's ambitious campaigns - both were veterans of the Battle of Granicus (334 BC), the first major battle Alexander fought in Asia. He was entrusted with supreme command of the Companion cavalry, served as Alexander's second-in-command, and was personally selected by Alexander in many of the key battles. Although popularly known as a close friend of Alexander, the two distinctive and separate historical figures have been confused in popular culture.

He was killed at the Battle of the Hydaspes in India in 324 BC, after being wounded by an arrow that became infected. After his death, he received divine status as a hero and his body was allegedly bound in beeswax and shipped back to Macedonia for burial in the royal tombs at Vergina. It is widely believed that Alexander's death was linked to his deep grief over the death of Hephaestion.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sample 3:</strong>Hephaestion (Ancient Greek: Ἡφαιστίων, Hēphaistíōn) was a son of Amyntor, a Macedonian noble. He was a close companion and general of Alexander the Great and was by Alexander's side in Naples when news of Philip II's death reached them in 336 BC. Alexander leapt to his feet, and immediately took over from his father, and dedicated a lion to the deceased king.

Hephaestion was an important figure in Alexander's life, and the two became close friends, joining forces in the first battle of their campaign against the Persian Empire. They were known to be so close that it was rumored they could read each other's thoughts, and it appears their relationship grew stronger as they conquered more and more. When Alexander died in Babylon, Hephaestion greatly mourned his friend's death, and swore to continue his campaigns as Alexander had wished. Shortly after, Hephaestion died himself.</p>

Much of Philip's early life was spent in the shadow of his father, who often returned from crusades disappointed and tormented. When Louis died, Philip inherited the throne of France at the outbreak of the 1131–1132 civil war and became King of France at the age of 14. His minority ended in 1135, when Philip was declared of age and crowned at Reims by Pope Innocent II. He was strongly advised by his mother, as well as Rober of Reims, abbot of the Abbey of St. Remy, to stay away from court and into the country. He chose to spend his time hunting and</p>

In 1069, Philip I married Bertrade de Montfort, the daughter of the Count of Montfort, and the union was annulled in 1092. Philip had no male heir, so although he proclaimed his son Baldwin VII of Flanders as his successor, there were tensions between the three surviving sons of Louis VI of France: Philip, Count of Flanders, and Otto, Count of Burgundy. Upon Philip's death, the crown passed to them. Philip I's second wife, Bertrade de Montfort, was the mother of Philip of France (1116–1131). Philip of France was the only son of King Louis VI of France and his second wife, Adela of Champagne. He was the younger brother of Louis VII, who ruled from 11</p>

He proposed the cell lineage theory (also known as the Pander model), which is broadly accepted as the founding idea of modern developmental biology. His theory inspired many later layers of study on the morphogenesis of embryos.

Pander was born on New Year's Day of 1907, in a rural farmhouse in Baltic Latvia. His father, a Lutheran pastor, taught him Latin and Greek and had a significant influence on his scientific aspirations. After finishing school in Latvia, Pander continued his studies at Heidelberg University, where he became the student of influential German zoologist Reissinger. After completing his doctoral degree in 1934, Pander taught anatomy at Heidelberg University, before becoming professor of zoology at Germany's University of Tubingen in 1938.

In 1829, he was appointed professor at the University of Kazan, where he served for 31 years.

Pander dedicated much of his work to the study of the embryology of vertebrates. He described the earliest stages of chick development and wrote the monograph "Ueber Entwickelung und Bildung des Hühnereies" (On the Development and Formation of an Egg), which described in detail the development of the chick embryo. He also wrote about lizard, snake, and fish development among others. He is best known for the law of Pander (also known as the "Pander-Balfour rule" after the work of Balfour), which</p>

He then served as Professor of Anatomy and Physiology in Halle from 1840 until his death in 1865. Pander is credited with making major advances in the understanding of human embryology, particuarly in the area of organogenesis. In 1817 and 1827, he discovered two separate pairs of locomotory and sensory organs in the vertebrates. He also published detailed descriptions of the development of human embryos up to the 10th week of gestation. Pander was remarkable for his detailed research at a time when most researchers were only just beginning to explore the biology of human embryology. His work was influential to subsequent generations of embryologists who developed the modern understanding of human development.</p>

He is known as one of the founding fathers of Neo-Kantianism, and was a leader in the development of the concept of value-free science. He emphasized the difference between the History of Nature, which studies the facts of nature, and the History of Humanity, which studies the meaning of human activity and the purpose of life. Windelband used the term "value-free" to describe his method. He argued that scientific inquiry was value-free in the sense that scientists should remain impartial and unconcerned with the moral purpose of their work. In his book A History of Philosophy he outlined the differences between the "ancients" and "moderns," which became a popular method of delineating the history of philosophy.</p>

He was a major figure in the development of the neo-Kantian school of thought. Windelband is best known for the terms ‘nomothetic’ and ‘idiographic’, which he introduced for the investigation of ‘respectively the general and the individual in sciences’. He was opposed to the classical empirical-inductive approach proposed by Wilhelm Wundt and his student, Hermann von Helmholtz. Windelband's works on the history of philosophy, ethics, and psychology profoundly influenced the evolution of German thought and helped to provide an introduction to analytic philosophy. He was also a historian of philosophy, and his major work, History of Philosophy, is a standard text in the field.</p>

He is now remembered mainly for the terms he coined, such as the “true” distinction between the Nomothetic and the Idiographic, his monist solution to the mind-body problem, and his advocacy of the study of the history of philosophy. Windelband was a Neo-Kantian who identified in the great systems of modern philosophy a fundamental opposition between the concepts of nomothetic and idiographic knowledge. The former deals in general laws and principles while the latter deals in individual facts. His intellectual project was validated by his being appointed to the chair of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg in 1883, which was then one of the major philosophical centers of German-speaking Europe. His students there included, among many others, the neo-Kantians Heinrich Rickert and Emil Lask, the phenomenologist Edmund Husserl, economists Alfred Weber and Alfred Marshall, psychologist Carl Stumpf, neurologist Ottmar von Verschuer, and the historians</p>

Kuper was a professor of anthropology at the University of the Witwatersrand, a position she held until her retirement in 1976. She was a founding member of the African National Congress Women's League, for which she was arrested in 1956. Kuper also helped to found the Liberal Party of South Africa, and was an executive member of the African Council of Namibia. In 1983, she received the Robert Schaler Award from the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology, in recognition of her lifetime of work and research.</p>
